Russia-led security alliance to send peacekeeping force

ALMATY, Jan 6 (Reuters) - A Russia-led security alliance of ex-Soviet states will send peacekeeping forces to Kazakhstan, Armenia's prime minister said on Thursday, after the Kazakh president appealed for their help in quelling violent and deadly protests.

Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan said on Facebook that an unspecified number of peacekeepers would go to Kazakhstan for a limited period to stabilise the situation after state buildings were torched and the Almaty international airport was seized.

Eight police and national guard troops were killed in the unrest on Tuesday and Wednesday, Russia's state-owned Sputnik agency quoted the Kazakh interior ministry as saying on Wednesday. Russian news agencies, quoting Kazakh media, later said two soldiers had also been killed in what they described as an anti-terrorist operation at Almaty airport.

Initially sparked by anger at a fuel price rise, the protests have quickly spread to take in wider opposition to President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev's predecessor Nursultan Nazarbayev, who retained significant power despite quitting in 2019 after a nearly three-decade rule.

Nazarbayev, 81, has been widely seen as the main political force in Nur-Sultan, the purpose-built capital which bears his name. His family is believed to control much of the economy, the largest in Central Asia. He has not been seen or heard from since the protests began.

The Central Asian nation's reputation for stability under Nazarbayev helped attract hundreds of billions of dollars of foreign investment in its oil and metals industries.

But a younger generation is demanding the liberalisation seen in other former satellite states of the Soviet Union. The protests are the worst in Kazakhstan - a country five times the size of France with a population of nearly 19 million people - in over a decade.

Apparently seeking to appease public ire, Tokayev sacked Nazarbayev as head of the powerful Security Council on Wednesday, and took it over himself. He also appointed a new head of the State Security Committee, successor to the Soviet-era KGB, and removed Nazarbayev's nephew from the No. 2 position on the committee.

Tokayev's Cabinet also resigned.

But protests continued, with demonstrators taking control of the airport in Almaty, Kazakhstan's biggest city, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters. Flights were cancelled.

Interfax quoted an official as saying the airport had subsequently been cleared of protesters. Reuters was not able to independently confirm the report.

Earlier, riot police used teargas and flash grenades against protesters in Almaty but then appeared to withdraw.

In the early hours of Thursday, in his second televised speech within hours, Tokayev said that he had appealed for help to the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO), a military alliance of Russia, Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan.

He said foreign-trained ""terrorist"" gangs were seizing buildings, infrastructure and weapons, and had taken five aircraft, including foreign ones, at Almaty airport.

""It is an undermining of the integrity of the state and most importantly it is an attack on our citizens who are asking me... to help them urgently,"" Tokayev said.

""Almaty was attacked, destroyed, vandalised, the residents of Almaty became victims of attacks by terrorists, bandits. Therefore it is our duty... to take all possible actions to protect our state.""

Russian news agencies quoted Dmitry Rogozin, head of the Russian space agency Roscosmos, as saying security had been strengthened around key installations at the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, which Russia uses for space launches.

'COMPLETE ANARCHY'

A resident of Almaty who mingled with the protesters on Wednesday said most of those he met appeared to come from the city's impoverished outskirts or nearby villages.

At the main square, vodka was being distributed and some people were discussing whether to head towards the city bazaar or a wealthy area for possible looting, the resident said.

""There is complete anarchy in the street,"" he said.

Footage posted on the internet showed protesters chanting below a giant bronze statue of Nazarbayev, strung with ropes in an apparent attempt to pull it down. A woman who posted it said it was filmed in the eastern city of Taldykorgan.

Early on Wednesday, Reuters journalists had seen thousands of protesters pressing towards Almaty city centre, while in the city of Aqtobe, protesters gathered shouting: ""Old Man, go away!"" A video online showed police using water cannon and stun grenades near the mayor's office.

States of emergency were declared in Nur-Sultan, Almaty, and westerly Mangistau province. The internet was shut down.

After accepting the Cabinet's resignation, Tokayev ordered acting ministers to reverse the fuel price rise, which doubled the cost of liquefied petroleum gas widely used for vehicles in Kazakhstan.

The Kremlin has said it expected Kazakhstan, a close ally, to quickly resolve its internal problems, warning other countries against interfering. White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Russian accusations that the United States had instigated the unrest were false.

Cuba sees biggest protests for decades as pandemic adds to woes,"HAVANA, July 11 (Reuters) - Chanting ""freedom"" and calling for President Miguel Diaz-Canel to step down, thousands of Cubans joined street protests from Havana to Santiago on Sunday in the biggest anti-government demonstrations on the Communist-run island in decades.

The protests erupted amid Cuba's worst economic crisis since the fall of the Soviet Union, its old ally, and a record surge in coronavirus infections, with people voicing anger over shortages of basic goods, curbs on civil liberties and the authorities' handling of the pandemic.

Thousands took to the streets in various parts of Havana including the historic centre, their shouts of “Diaz-Canel step down” drowning out groups of government supporters waving the Cuban flag and chanting ""Fidel.""

Special forces jeeps, with machine guns mounted on the back were seen throughout the capital and the police presence was heavy even long after most protesters had gone home by the 9 p.m. curfew in place due to the pandemic.

""We are going through really difficult times,"" Miranda Lazara, 53, a dance teacher, who joined the thousands of protesters who marched through Havana. ""We need a change of system.""

Diaz-Canel, who also heads the Communist Party, blamed the unrest on old Cold War foe the United States, which in recent years tightened its decades-old trade embargo on the island, in a televised speech on Sunday afternoon.

Diaz-Canel said many protesters were sincere but manipulated by U.S.-orchestrated social media campaigns and “mercenaries” on the ground, and warned that further “provocations” would not be tolerated, calling on supporters to confront “provocations.""

The president was due to make another address to the nation at 9 a.m. on Monday, according to state-run media.

Julie Chung, acting undersecretary of the U.S. State Department's Office of Western Hemisphere Affairs, said it was deeply concerned by “calls to combat” in Cuba and stood by the Cuban people’s right for peaceful assembly.""

Reuters witnesses in Havana protests saw security forces, aided by suspected plain clothes officers, arrest about two dozen protesters. Police used pepper spray and hit some protesters as well as a photographer working for the Associated Press.

In one area of Havana, protesters took out their anger on an empty police car, rolling it over and then throwing stones at it. Elsewhere, they chanted ""repressors"" at riot police.

Some protesters said they went on to the streets to join in after seeing what was happening on social media, which has become an increasingly important factor since the introduction of mobile internet two and a half years ago, although connections were patchy on Sunday.

NATIONWIDE PROTESTS

The Caribbean island nation of 11 million inhabitants where public dissident is usually restricted has seen a growing number of protests over the past year although nothing on this scale or simultaneously in so many cities.

The anti-government demonstrations were the largest since the summer of 1994, said Michael Bustamante, an assistant professor of Latin American history at Florida International University.

""Only now, they weren't limited to the capital; they didn't even start there, it seems,"" he said.

Sunday's demonstrations broke out at around midday in San Antonio de los Banos municipality in Artemisa Province, bordering Havana. Video on social media showed hundreds of residents chanting anti-government slogans and demanding everything from coronavirus vaccines to an end of daily blackouts.

“I just walked through town looking to buy some food and there were lots of people there, some with signs, protesting,” resident Claris Ramirez said by phone. “They are protesting blackouts, that there is no medicine"".

President Diaz-Canel visited the town, later saying in his broadcast remarks: ""We are calling on all the revolutionaries in the country, all the Communists, to hit the streets wherever there is an effort to produce these provocations"".

There were protests later on Sunday hundreds of miles to the east in Palma Soriano, Santiago de Cuba, where social media video showed hundreds marching through the streets, again confirmed by a resident.

“They are protesting the crisis, that there is no food or medicine, that you have to buy everything at the foreign currency stores, and on and on the list goes,” the resident, Claudia Perez, said.

The protests in Havana started around 3 p.m. and fizzled out around 8 p.m., with some protesters giving up after security forces thwarted their attempt to reach Revolution Square

Cuba has been experiencing a worsening economic crisis for two years, which the government blames mainly on U.S. sanctions and the pandemic, while its detractors cite incompetence and a Soviet-style one-party system.

A combination of sanctions, inefficiencies and the pandemic has shut down tourism and slowed other foreign revenue flows in a country dependent on them to import the bulk of its food, fuel and inputs for agriculture and manufacturing.

The economy contracted 10.9% last year, and 2% through June of 2021. The resulting cash crunch has spawned shortages that have forced Cubans to queue for hours for basic goods throughout the pandemic.

Cuba has begun a mass vaccination campaign, with 1.7 million of its 11.2 million residents vaccinated to date and twice that many have received at least one shot in the three-shot process.

Still, the arrival of the Delta variant has prompted cases to surge, with health authorities reporting a record 6,923 cases and 47 deaths on Sunday - twice as many as the previous week. Hospitals in the worst affected province have been overwhelmed.

Myanmar marks coup anniversary with protests and unrest,"Summary Protesters and military supporters mark anniversary

Junta extends state of emergency to thwart 'saboteurs'

Explosion at pro-army rally kills 2 - witnesses

Calls grow for global halt on arms sales to junta

Man sets himself on fire to protest power outages

Feb 1 (Reuters) - Streets in some of Myanmar's main cities were nearly deserted on Tuesday as opponents of military rule held ""silent strikes"", marking the first anniversary of a coup that led to deadly chaos and snuffed out tentative steps towards democracy.

The United States, Britain and Canada imposed new sanctions on the military and joined other countries in calling for a global halt in arms sales to Myanmar, a year after Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi's elected government was overthrown.

Since its bloody suppression of protests in the weeks following the coup, the military has faced armed resistance on multiple fronts in the countryside from groups allied with the ousted government.

On Tuesday, an explosion took place during a procession of military supporters in the eastern border town of Tachileik, two witnesses told Reuters. The blast killed two people, said one of the witnesses, and wounded more than 30 others.

State media on Tuesday said junta chief Min Aung Hlaing extended a state of emergency for a further six months to address threats from ""internal and external saboteurs"" and ""terrorist attacks and destruction"".

Activists urged people to stay indoors and businesses to close in a silent show of defiance, despite warnings of arrests, jail and a seizure of businesses.

""We might be arrested and spend our life in jail if we're lucky. We might be tortured and killed if we're unlucky,"" saidyouth activist Nan Lin.

A military spokesman did not respond to telephone calls seeking comment on Tuesday.

STREETS QUIET

Images on social media showed quiet streets in various cities including Mandalay, Magway, Myitkyina and Yangon, where pictures on a page put up by strike organisers later showed a small protest at which people threw red paint on the ground.

A man set himself on fire in the central town of Kyaukdataung and was in a serious condition in hospital, according to a resident and to local news outlets, which said the man was protesting at intermittent power supplies.

""He set fire to himself at the Main Street in front of the electricity office,"" a resident told Reuters by phone. ""He is in a serious condition. The situation is quite unstable here today.""

There were also pro-junta events in several locations, including the capital, Naypyitaw, where thousands attended a rally, some dancing and holding aloft photographs of Min Aung Hlaing, with banners wishing him good health.

The was no claim of responsibility for the explosion in Tachileik and a local militia group did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The town's news agency said a soldier was among the two killed, and veterans among the wounded.

""We all heard an explosion and people ran randomly, shouting loudly,"" a witness told Reuters by phone. ""I hid inside the house.""

Another witness told Reuters two people died instantly and the town was now deserted.

HUGE BACKLASH

Such violence has become commonplace in Myanmar in the year since Suu Kyi and other ruling party members were arrested as they prepared to take their seats in parliament, after winning a 2020 election the generals accused them of rigging.

The coup triggered a huge backlash, with strikes and protests that led to about 1,500 civilians being killed in crackdowns and more than 11,787 unlawfully held, according to United Nations human rights office figures on Tuesday.

A junta spokesman did not respond to calls seeking comment on the U.N. figures. It has previously disputed similar numbers from human rights groups.

The U.N. human rights expert on Myanmar, Tom Andrews, on Tuesday said the junta was functioning like a criminal enterprise, harming its people and stealing their resources.

""The international community must take strong, meaningful steps to cut the junta's access to weapons, funds and legitimacy,"" Andrews said.

The military has accused the U.N. of bias and interference and is refusing to bow to international pressure, despite a corporate retreat from Myanmar and sanctions. read more

The military ruled for decades after a 1962 coup but had begun to withdraw from politics in 2010, freeing Suu Kyi after years of house arrest.

Her party formed a government after a 2015 election, but was required to share power with the army until the military abruptly ended the experiment with reform a year ago.

Life has become a grind for many since then with the economy withering, regular power cuts and internet curbs.

Suu Kyi, 76, is on trial in more than a dozen cases that carry a combined maximum sentence of more than 150 years in prison.

An internationally backed diplomatic effort led by Southeast Asian countries has faltered.

""It's very lamentable, until this time there has not been significant progress,"" Indonesia's foreign ministry said.

Singapore said conditions for the Myanmar people continued to deteriorate and called for progress and Suu Kyi's release.

Canada rules out use of troops against truckers' blockade; more protests planned,"OTTAWA, Feb 3 (Reuters) - The Canadian government will not use troops against truckers whose nearly week-long protest of coronavirus vaccine mandates has brought traffic in central Ottawa to a halt, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Thursday.

More than 200 trucks and other vehicles have been blockading downtown roads in the nation's capital since last Friday in what is an unprecedented protest by Canadian standards.

Organizers say drivers plan to hold similar protests in Toronto, the country's most populous city and its financial hub, and Quebec City later this week amid growing frustration over almost two years of restrictions imposed to fight COVID-19.

Ottawa residents are angry that local police are largely watching the demonstrations rather than moving in to break them up. The city's police chief on Wednesday indicated guns were being smuggled into the protest and said using the military was an option, but Trudeau dismissed the idea.

""There is no question of sending in the army,"" the prime minister said.

Some demonstrators want an end to a federal COVID-19 vaccine mandate for cross-border truckers while others insist Trudeau be removed from power on the grounds he exceeded his authority.

Protest organizer Tamara Lich said the demonstrators would stay in place until all mandates had been dropped.

""Our movement has grown in Canada and across the world because common people are tired of the mandates and restrictions in their lives that now seem to be doing more harm than good,"" she told a news conference.

A few people on Ottawa streets have brandished Nazi flags, harassed minorities and threatened reporters.

""That is unacceptable. It's time for these people to go home,"" Trudeau told reporters.

Ottawa police, who have made just three arrests so far, issued 30 traffic tickets on Wednesday.

The protesters have raised more than C$10 million ($7.9 million) on the crowdfunding platform GoFundMe, which has suspended disbursements while it checks on how the money is being spent.

Legislators on the House of Commons public safety committee voted on Thursday to summon GoFundMe representatives to testify about what safeguards it has in place when it comes to releasing the funds.

'LESSONS TO BE LEARNED'

Quebec Premier Francois Legault said authorities would not tolerate any mayhem related to protests. Quebec City Mayor Bruno Marchand told a radio station that ""there are lessons to be learned from Ottawa.""

Trudeau's Liberals look set to benefit politically from the protests, which have split the official opposition Conservative Party. Federal Conservative lawmakers ousted leader Erin O'Toole on Wednesday, citing his poor performance in an election defeat to the Liberals last September and his initial, lukewarm support for the protests.

Former Conservative leader Andrew Scheer and other parliamentarians later posed with truckers, a move Ottawa Mayor Jim Watson branded ""an absolute disgrace.""

Salvador street protest breaks out against bitcoin adoption,"A person holds a sign that reads 'The Bitcoin bill must be repealed, it will bring more corruption and poverty', as people participate in a protest against the use of Bitcoin as legal tender, in San Salvador, El Salvador, September 7, 2021. REUTERS/Jose Cabezas

SAN SALVADOR, Sept 7 (Reuters) - More than 1,000 people marched in El Salvador's capital on Tuesday to protest the adoption of bitcoin as legal tender, amid a bumpy initial rollout of systems to support the digital currency.

The protesters burned a tire and set off fireworks in front of the Supreme Court building around noon local time, as the government deployed heavily militarized police to the site of the protest.

""This is a currency that's not going to work for pupusa vendors, bus drivers or shopkeepers,"" said a San Salvador resident who opposed the adoption of the cryptocurrency. Pupusas are a traditional Salvadoran corn-based food.

""This is a currency that's ideal for big investors who want to speculate with their economic resources.""

The protest came as El Salvador's government was rushing to iron out technological snags in bitcoin's first-day rollout.

Earlier on Tuesday, Salvadorans trying to download the Chivo digital wallet found it was unavailable on popular app stores. Then Bukele tweeted that the government had temporarily unplugged it, in order to connect more servers to deal with demand.

A group of people in Chivo tee-shirts at a stall to train people interested in using the app milled around waiting for it to be reconnected.

It later appeared on Apple and Huawei's stores, and Bukele used Twitter to ask users to let him know how it was working.

Polls indicate many Salvadorans are wary of the volatility of the cryptocurrency, which can shed hundreds of dollars in value in a day. That view is shared by many economists worried at how it will affect economic stability.

However, others have embraced it as a way ordinary people in a poor country can invest in financial markets.

Ahead of the launch, El Salvador bought 400 bitcoins worth around $20 million, Bukele said, helping drive the price of the currency above $52,000 for the first time since May. Hours later, however, bitcoin had weakened and last traded down 8.84% at $47,327.32. L8N2Q927A

Mass protests held in Sudan against prospect of military rule,"KHARTOUM, Oct 21 (Reuters) - Huge crowds of people marched in several parts of the Sudanese capital and other cities on Thursday in demonstrations against the prospect of military rule, as the crisis in the country's troubled transition from authoritarian rule deepened.

The military has shared power with civilian parties in a transitional authority since the removal of President Omar al-Bashir in 2019 in a popular uprising after three decades of his rule.

A coalition of rebel groups and political parties have aligned themselves with the military, which has accused the civilian parties of mismanagement and monopolising power, and they are seeking to dissolve the cabinet.

Civilian leaders say that this would amount to a coup and that the military aims to install a government it can control.

Thursday's protest, which began at midday and continued after sundown, took place on the anniversary of the 1964 October Revolution that overthrew a military government and led to a period of parliamentary democracy.

It was preceded by days of smaller neighbourhood protests.

Reuters journalists estimated the number of participants to be in the hundreds of thousands, making it the biggest demonstration of the transition.

Plumes of smoke could be seen across Khartoum as protesters burned tires and waved Sudanese flags.

Many chants were critical of the head of the ruling Sovereign Council, General Abdel Fattah Al-Burhan, accusing him of being loyal to Bashir. Some demanded he hand over leadership to civilians and others demanded his removal.

""This country is ours, and our government is civilian,"" one chant said.

The Central Committee of Sudanese Doctors said 37 people were injured in the protests, which it blamed on government forces, including four gunshot victims.

State television said police used tear gas and live bullets to break up protests in front of the parliament building in Omdurman.

In a statement, police said rogue protesters in Omdurman set a police vehicle on fire and attacked police officers, shooting two. Officers then used a ""legal amount"" of riot control to disperse the crowd, it said. Eyewitnesses said protesters were tear gassed heavily.

Several government ministers and officials were seen marching in different parts of Khartoum.

""October 21 is a lesson for any tyrants, loyalists, or opportunists deluded into thinking they can turn back the hands of time,"" wrote civilian Sovereign Council member Siddig Tawer.

Neighbourhood resistance committees said in a statement they were protesting against the entire power-sharing agreement and demanded sole civilian rule.

Many businesses in central Khartoum were closed in anticipation of the protest and there was an extensive police presence.

The military says it is committed to the transition to democracy and elections at the end of 2023.

Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok, who leads the cabinet under a military-civilian power-sharing agreement, remains popular despite an economic crisis. He has said he is speaking to all sides in the crisis in order to find a solution.

In a statement Thursday evening, he said he saluted the protesters, saying ""the crowds have made their voices heard and delivered their message that there is no going back from the goals of the revolution.""

Military-aligned groups led by rebel group leaders and current government officials Minni Minnawi and Jibril Ibrahim have held a sit-in in front of the presidential palace in downtown Khartoum since Saturday.

Protest routes were planned in other areas of the city to avoid a confrontation with the sit-in.

""We encourage demonstrators to be peaceful and remind them of the strong U.S. support for Sudan's democratic transition,"" the U.S. Embassy wrote on Twitter.

"'No harvests': Peru farm protests grip country, turn deadly","LIMA (Reuters) - Protests by farm workers demanding better wages in Peru raged on for a fourth day Thursday, spreading north into key agricultural areas of the Andean nation, derailing harvests of some crops, snarling transport of produce and leaving at least one dead.

Slideshow ( 5 images )

Peruvian interim President Francisco Sagasti called the death of a protester a “tragedy” and told reporters the government would immediately investigate the first casualty in demonstrations over farm worker rights and wages that began on Monday.

“We do not want anyone to die in protests to defend their labor rights,” Sagasti said.

The death of two young people in Lima last month led to the resignation of Sagasti’s predecessor, Manuel Merino, prompting renewed scrutiny of the actions of security forces in the Andean nation.

Farm workers alleged police had attacked protesters to clear roadways and tame the demonstrations, which spread northwards from the country’s south into regions known for vast fields of table grapes, tangerines and blueberries.

“The workers ... have been attacked by the police who have arrived in great numbers to prevent them from continuing to block the road,” said Juan Herrera, a national leader of agrarian workers.

Workers from Camposol, a major fruit exporter, joined the fray on Thursday. Farm laborers from agro-exporter Talsa announced they too would join the rallies on Friday.

“All activities have been paralyzed, there are no harvests, there is nothing. Grapes and asparagus are going bad, we are in the middle of the season for these two crops,” Fernando Cilloniz, a grape exporter, told Reuters.

"Explainer: What's behind Haiti's deadly protests, and possible outcomes","PORT-AU-PRINCE (Reuters) - Haiti, the poorest country in the Americas, has been rocked by violent protests in the last month that have led schools, public offices and businesses to close and forced non-governmental organizations to suspend aid distribution.

Opposition leaders and their supporters in the nation of 11 million are calling for the resignation of President Jovenel Moise, 51, amid anger over fuel and food shortages, a steep currency devaluation and corruption allegations.

This is the longest stretch of demonstrations against Moise since they broke out last year. At least 17 people have been killed and 189 injured, according to Haiti’s National Network for the Defense of Human Rights.

The following explains the causes of the crisis as well as possible outcomes:

WHAT SPARKED THIS BOUT OF PROTESTS?

Haitians are angry at fuel shortages since the collapse of the PetroCaribe program under which Venezuela for a decade offered aid and cheap financing to several Caribbean nations to buy its gasoline, diesel and other products.

The cash-strapped country has struggled to import enough at market prices. Gas stations are regularly out of fuel for days at a time and blackouts increasingly common.

The shortages plus government attempts to reduce fuel subsidies have caused prices to soar, exacerbating an already dire economic situation.

More than half of the population lives below the poverty line, surviving on less than 2.4 U.S. dollars a day, according to the World Bank.

“The days of lockdown have paralyzed the economic activity and made it worse,” Haitian economist Etzer Emile said.

“But at the end the main concern is that the government is not able to give an appropriate response. The country is out of control.”

Allegations in a report by the Superior Court of Auditors of the embezzlement of billions of dollars by public officials and those close to them, including Moise before he became president, have also sparked ire.

The PetroCaribe program included a fund for infrastructure and social projects in member countries. Opposition politicians say no serious projects were ever completed.

Moise, whom some opposition members accuse of buying votes in parliament for his prime minister nominees, has denied any wrongdoing, but his government has failed to investigate further.

Haiti ranked 161 from 180 countries in Transparency International’s 2018 global survey of corruption.

WHAT’S THE BROADER BACKDROP?

Haiti has struggled to achieve political stability since a popular uprising in 1986 ended 28 years of dynastic dictatorship by Francois “Papa Doc” Duvalier and his son Jean-Claude “Baby Doc” Duvalier.

The last few decades have been marked by coups, unrest and foreign interventions.

Only two presidents have managed to serve their entire term.

Haiti has not had a government since March as Moise has been unable to get the opposition on board with his nominations.

Successive governments have failed to spark real development in the island nation that has to regularly contend with deadly natural disasters from hurricanes to earthquakes.

The country had received much aid in the wake of the 2010 quake that killed around 300,000, but that has tapered off of late. Moise, however, has not cut expenses, meaning the budget deficit has deepened to record levels, according to Haitian economist Kesner Pharel.

The local currency has depreciated around 30 percent against the dollar in the last year and inflation is running at around 20 percent, he said. Haiti’s main source of hard currency is remittances.

Around half of the population was undernourished last year, according to the United Nations, while swathes of the country do not have access to electricity, basic sanitation or healthcare.

As a result, many Haitians have lost faith in politics. Only 21 percent of the electorate turned out for the last presidential election in 2016.

Opposition politicians say that fact undermines the legitimacy of the presidency of Moise, a former businessman with little prior political experience.

But they have themselves failed to get voters out to polling booths, instead resorting to disrupting parliament and calling for street protests, making Haiti hard to govern.

HOW HAS THE GOVERNMENT RESPONDED?

Moise, who has two years left in his term, has taken few public steps to address peoples’ grievances since protests first broke out a year ago.

He has also not spoken in public since the beginning of this latest round of protests, sparking accusations of a leadership vacuum.

The president first addressed the nation two weeks into the riots, in a pre-recorded speech broadcast on television at 2 a.m. in which he made a plea for dialogue and unity.

This week he named a commission of seven politicians from his own party or allied with it to lead discussions to find a solution to end the crisis.

WHAT IS THE OPPOSITION’S STANCE?

The so-called radical opposition, which is spearheading the protests, says the time for dialogue has passed, making it clear it will continue to call for protests until Moise resigns.

On Oct. 1 it created a nine-member commission to oversee an orderly transition of power.

Even some politicians and sectors of society like the business community who had previously backed Moise are beginning to question his capacity to lead Haiti out of its current crisis.

The leader of the Senate, Carl Murat Cantave, who is from a different party but claims to be neutral, appealed to him in a speech this week to put “all options on the table”, including that of shortening his mandate to make way for a new president.

“Surpass yourself,” he said, “so that Haiti can rise up again from its ashes and do better.”",2019-10-11 11:31:34,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-haiti-protests-explainer-idUSKBN1WQ22P,8
"Rohingya repatriation process stalls amid refugee protests, recriminations","COX’S BAZAR, Bangladesh/YANGON (Reuters) - A plan to begin repatriating hundreds of thousands of Rohingya Muslim refugees to Myanmar stalled on Thursday, amid protests by refugees at camps in Bangladesh and recriminations between the officials in both countries.

The delay is a major setback for both nations and it leaves one of the world’s biggest refugee crises unresolved. Officials on both sides blamed each other for the lack of progress on the bilateral plan that had been agreed on in late October.

Bangladesh had begun preparations to repatriate an initial batch of 2,200 Rohingya to Myanmar on Thursday, but there have been extensive doubts about the plan. It has been opposed by Rohingya at camps in Bangladesh and the U.N. refugee agency and aid groups, who fear for the safety of the Rohingya in Myanmar.

Hundreds of Rohingya Muslim refugees in Bangladesh protested on Thursday against any attempt to send them back, and by late afternoon no refugees had returned, Myanmar officials said.

Myanmar blamed Bangladesh for failing to bring any returnees but said it remained ready to accept them.

“To be honest, Bangladesh is weak in following the physical arrangement,” said Myint Thu, permanent secretary at Myanmar’s foreign affairs ministry, at a media briefing.

“We will accept them according to the agreement signed by the two countries. Whether they come back or not is their own decision,” said Myint Thu.

Unverified images on social media showed officials on the Myanmar side of the border waiting idle at a reception center.

Bangladesh has vowed not to force anyone to return and it has asked the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to ensure those short-listed to return really want to go back.

Bangladesh’s Refugee Relief and Repatriation Commissioner Abul Kalam told Reuters on Thursday that his government had left no stone unturned.

“We made all preparations. Everything was ready: the transit camp, buses to carry them to border, medical facilities, rations for three days for the returnees,” said Kalam. “How they can say we are weak in physical arrangements? If Rohingya don’t want to return what can we do? We will not send them forcefully.”

Kalam called on the international community to put pressure on Myanmar to accept “some logical and acceptable demands,” in order for any repatriation to take place.

“WE WON’T GO”

The Rohingya demand that Myanmar recognizes their ethnic identity, grants them citizenship and allows them to return to their original homes and lands.

Myanmar does not consider the Rohingya a native ethnic group and most are stateless. Many in the Buddhist-majority country call Rohingya “Bengalis”, suggesting they belong in Bangladesh.

Earlier on Thursday, Rohingya protesters chanted “No, no, we won’t go,” at the Unchiprang camp in southeast Bangladesh near the Myanmar border.

Some also waved placards that said “We want justice” and “We will never return to Myanmar without our citizenship.”

More than 700,000 Rohingya fled a sweeping army crackdown in Myanmar’s Rakhine state last year, according to U.N. agencies. The crackdown was launched in response to Rohingya insurgent attacks on security forces.

The Rohingya refugees say soldiers and Buddhist civilians massacred families, burned hundreds of villages and carried out gang rapes. U.N-mandated investigators have accused the Myanmar army of “genocidal intent” and ethnic cleansing.

Myanmar denies almost all the accusations, saying its forces engaged in a counter-insurgency operation against “terrorists.”

U.N. rights boss Michelle Bachelet had called on Bangladesh this week to halt the repatriation plan, warning lives would be put at “serious risk”.

The U.N. human rights office continued to receive reports of ongoing violations against Rohingya in Myanmar including allegations of killings, disappearances and arbitrary arrests, Bachelet said.",2018-11-14 12:56:49,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-myanmar-rohingya-bangladesh-idUSKCN1NJ2K1,9
Timeline: Key dates in Hong Kong's protests,"HONG KONG (Reuters) - A young demonstrator was shot and police fired tear gas and water cannon at petrol-bomb throwing protesters, as violence flared in Hong Kong as the city’s Chinese rulers celebrated the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic.

Tuesday’s unrest was the most widespread in nearly four months of street clashes and demonstrations that have plunged the former British colony into its biggest political crisis in decades and pose the most serious popular challenge to China’s President Xi Jinping since he came to power.

Protests were sparked in June by planned legislation that would have allowed the extradition of suspected criminals to mainland China. The bill was later withdrawn, but the protests have since expanded into a broader pro-democracy movement.

Following is a timeline of the key dates around the extradition bill and the protests it triggered:

February 2019 – Hong Kong’s Security Bureau submits a paper to the city’s legislature proposing amendments to extradition laws that would provide for case-by-case extraditions to countries, including mainland China, beyond the 20 states with which Hong Kong already has treaties.

March 31 - Thousands take to the streets of Hong Kong to protest against the proposed extradition bill.

April 3 – Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam’s government introduces amendments to Hong Kong’s extradition laws that would allow criminal suspects to be sent to mainland China for trial.

April 28 – Tens of thousands of people march on Hong Kong’s city assembly building, the Legislative Council, to demand the scrapping of the proposed amendments to the extradition laws.

May 11 – Scuffles break out in Hong Kong’s legislature between pro-democracy lawmakers and those loyal to Beijing over the extradition bill.

May 21 – Lam says her administration is determined to push the bill through the legislature.

May 30 – Hong Kong introduces concessions to the extradition bill, including limiting the scope of extraditable offences. Critics say they are not enough.

Slideshow ( 3 images )

June 6 – More than 3,000 Hong Kong lawyers take to the streets dressed in black in a rare protest march against the extradition law.

June 9 - More than half a million take to the streets in protest.

June 12 – Police fire rubber bullets and tear gas during the city’s largest and most violent protests in decades. Government offices are shut for the rest of the week.

June 15 – Lam indefinitely delays the proposed extradition law.

July 1 - Protesters storm the Legislative Council on the 22nd anniversary of the handover from British to Chinese rule, destroying pictures and daubing walls with graffiti.

July 9 - Lam says the extradition bill is dead and that government work on the legislation had been a “total failure”.

July 21 - Men, clad in white T-shirts and some armed with poles, flood into rural Yuen Long station and storm a train, attacking passengers and passers-by, including members of the media, after several thousand activists surrounded China’s representative office in the city earlier in the day, and clashed with police.

July 30 - Forty-four activists are charged with rioting, the first time this charge has been used during these protests.

Aug. 9 - China’s aviation regulator demands Hong Kong flag carrier Cathay Pacific suspend personnel who have taken part in the protests. The airline suspends a pilot, one of 44 charged with rioting the month before, the next day.

Aug. 14 - Police and protesters clash at Hong Kong’s international airport after flights were disrupted for a second day. The airport resumed operations later that day, rescheduling hundreds of flights.

Aug. 21 - China’s biggest e-commerce company Alibaba delays its up to $15 billion listing in Hong Kong, initially set for late August.

Sept. 2 - Lam says she has caused “unforgivable havoc” by igniting the political crisis engulfing the city and would quit if she had a choice, according to an audio recording obtained by Reuters of remarks she made to a group of businesspeople.

Sept. 3 - Lam says she had never asked the Chinese government to let her resign to end the city’s political crisis, responding to the Reuters report.

Sept. 4 - Lam announces formal withdrawal of controversial extradition bill. Critics say it is too little, too late.

Sept. 7 - Police fire tear gas for a second consecutive night after fending off airport protests.

Sept. 8 - Security forces fire tear gas to disperse protesters in upmarket Causeway Bay shopping district.

Sept. 17 - Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam pledges to hold talks with the community to try to ease tensions.

Sept. 22 - Hong Kong police fire tear gas to break up pro-democracy demonstrators who trashed fittings at a railway station and shopping mall.

Sept. 26 - Hong Kong protesters trap city leader Carrie Lam in a stadium for hours after she holds her first “open dialogue” with the people.

ADEN, Sept 15 (Reuters) - Three people were killed in violent protests in Aden and other cities in south Yemen over widespread poverty and electricity outages as public services have collapsed within areas controlled by a Saudi-backed alliance.

Two protesters died in Aden and in Mukalla the neighbouring southern Hadhramaut region on Wednesday when violent clashes resumed between demonstrators and security forces, eyewitnesses said. Security forces fired live ammunition to disperse hundreds of young protesters who gathered in the two cities, they said.

One protester was killed and dozens were wounded on Tuesday night in Aden, other residents told Reuters.

Hundreds of stone-throwing protesters clashed with security forces in Aden's Khour Maksour, Crater and Sheikh Othman districts where demonstrators blocked roads, set fire to government buildings and burned cars in the streets.

""We came out to protest after our life has become impossible. There is no electricity, no water, and salaries can't buy us anything. We are not going to wait until we die,"" said Ahmed Saleh, 34, a protester and government employee.

Other protests were reported in Shabwa and Abyan provinces over the last two days.

South Yemen has been paralysed by a power struggle between the Saudi-backed government and the United Arab Emirates-backed southern separatists. They are nominal allies under a Saudi-led coalition fighting the Iran-aligned Houthi group in the North.

The Southern Transitional Council (STC), fighting for the independence of the South, had seized Aden and other southern areas before Saudi Arabia brokered a power-sharing deal to focus its feuding allies on the battle against the Houthis.

Conflict has crippled public services with frequent power outages that disrupt distribution of water, aid supplies and medical services. Unemployment and spiralling inflation have compounded the misery in a country where most of the 29 million people rely on aid.

PROTESTERS GATHER AGAIN

On Wednesday morning, Aden's streets were calm but stores and humanitarian organisations' offices were closed. Remains of charred cars and roadblocks were seen in many parts of the city.

After sunset, protesters started to gather again in Aden's dark streets in several districts.

An STC spokesman had called for more protests on Wednesday against ""the occupation"" of the government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi.

Other witnesses said dozens of demonstrators stormed Maashiq presidential palace where Hadi's government is based.

That government said security forces would protect protesters but would not tolerate ""destruction of public and private property.""

The military coalition led by Saudi Arabia drove out the Houthi movement from Aden in 2015, but the alliance failed to dislodge the group from Sanaa and other parts of the North, and the multifaceted war has reached a bloody stalemate.

The conflict has created what the United Nations says is the world's largest humanitarian crisis.

Hundreds march in Tunisia as protests sharpen,"TUNIS (Reuters) - Hundreds of people marched in central Tunis on Saturday against inequality and police brutality, in defiance of a ban on demonstrations and as security forces tried to block off the city’s main central avenue.

Protesters chanted “the people want the fall of the regime” - a chant popularised during the so-call Arab Spring a decade ago - and held up banners and slogans decrying the security response to more than a week of demonstrations and nightly clashes between youths and police in cities across Tunisia.

The protests, 10 years after a popular revolt against autocratic rule introduced democracy in Tunisia, represent the biggest bout of political unrest in several years, with police detaining hundreds of people.

“We can’t accept a police state in Tunisia 10 years after the revolution... it is shameful,” said Mahmoud, a young cafe worker who did not give his family name.

While the youths clashing with riot police after dark in poor districts of Tunisian cities have voiced few clear political aims, daytime protests have focused on the lack of jobs and on the police response to demonstrations.

The COVID-19 pandemic has aggravated an already dire economy in Tunisia, where many young people seek only to emigrate to Europe and see few opportunities at home.

At Habib Bourguiba Avenue, the stately tree-lined thoroughfare running from the sea up to the old city of Tunis, police placed barricades to stop protesters gathering.

Demonstrators instead rallied outside the central bank building and marched through the city, plainclothes police moving on each side with two-way radios.

The government banned protests last week in what it said was an attempt to reduce the spread of COVID-19.

Though protesters later managed to reach Habib Bourguiba, a symbolic focal point of the 2011 uprising, the attempt to close off the avenue underscored government unease at the momentum of the protests.",2021-01-24 03:07:45,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-tunisia-protests-idUSKBN29T059,12
Burkina Faso protest against militant violence turns violent,"OUAGADOUGOU, Nov 27 (Reuters) - Protesters burned tyres and pillaged a government building in Burkina Faso's capital on Saturday after police fired tear gas to disperse a march against the state's failure to stop a wave of violence by Islamist militants.

Activist groups called for renewed protests in response to a recent surge of attacks in the West African country, including one by al Qaeda-linked militants that killed 49 military police officers and four civilians two weeks ago. read more

The assault near the northern town of Inata was the deadliest Burkinabe security forces have suffered since an insurgency broke out in 2015 and has fuelled anger against the government and the French military forces that support it.

Since then, there have been scattered protests against President Roch Kabore's government. On Saturday morning, military police officers launched tear gas canisters to disperse about 100 protesters who were trying to march toward downtown Ouagadougou, the capital, a Reuters reporter said.

Demonstrators in the city of Kaya also prevented the passage of a French military convoy on its way to neighbouring Niger for nearly a week. read more

In Ouagadougou, protesters erected barricades and burned tyres and trash cans. Some demonstrators later vandalised a government records building across from the mayor's office, leaving computers and documents in the street.

""Since he (Kabore) is in power, terrorists are spreading desolation in this country and he is incapable of finding a solution to this problem. So we ask for his immediate resignation,"" Valentin Yamkoudougou, spokesperson for the ""Save Burkina Faso"" movement that organised the protest, told Reuters.

Kabore promised in a speech to the nation on Thursday to end ""dysfunction"" within the military after reports the gendarmes at the base near Inata had run out of food weeks before the attack.

The public's angry response to the latest attacks has unnerved the authorities, who cut mobile internet access a week ago and refused to authorise Saturday's demonstration.

The United Nations' special envoy to West Africa said on Thursday he was concerned about the situation in Burkina Faso and warned against any military takeover, following coups in three neighbouring countries over the past year. read more

Melbourne police arrest 200 at COVID-19 lockdown protests,"Summary More than 200 arrested on third successive day of protests

Temporary no-fly zone declared over Melbourne

Victoria's daily rise in cases is biggest this year

SYDNEY, Sept 22 (Reuters) - Police in Australia's second largest city of Melbourne arrested more than 200 people after projectiles thrown by protesters injured two officers on Wednesday, the third consecutive day of demonstrations against COVID-19 curbs.

Golf balls, batteries and bottles were among the items thrown at police during the protests held in defiance of stay-at home orders after a two-week closure of building sites to rein in infections, which rose again in the state of Victoria.

Police are bracing for more demonstrations in the next few days, said deputy commissioner Ross Guenther, adding that the motives of some participants had seemed unclear.

""There weren't as many tradies involved...there are other small breakaway groups that see benefit in hijacking these things,"" Guenther told reporters.

""We've got plenty of resources. We will vary our tactics tomorrow, if that is what we need to do, but of course, my message is, 'Don't come into the city.'""

Earlier, authorities and union officials had said extremist and far-right groups also joined the protests.

""There were some people there who you would say were from the building industry,"" state premier Daniel Andrews told reporters.

""There were others who were not ... they are not there to protest, they are there for a fight, pretend to be protesting.""

The protests came after decisions by authorities to make vaccines mandatory for construction workers and shut construction sites from Tuesday, citing non-compliance with health rules.

Groups of protesters roamed the streets and about 300 gathered at a city landmark, but most avoided clashes with busloads of police after protests on Tuesday in which more than 2,000 demonstrators damaged property and injured three police. read more

Media complained after police asked the aviation authority to declare a no-fly zone above Melbourne, the capital of Victoria, in what Guenther called an effort to ensure that footage gave away no details of police tactics to protesters.

Later, the decision was modified to let TV helicopters film on condition of an hour's delay in broadcast, he added.

Television images showed a police group using capsicum spray and foam baton rounds to disperse hundreds of protesters at the Shrine of Remembrance, which honours war service.

Many protesters face fines of A$5,000 ($3,626) for breaches of COVID-19 directives, Guenther added.

Some protesters have refused to speak to reporters on the scene, chanting ""Fake news"" when approached, media said. Others held banners with the slogan, ""End lockdown now!""

RE-OPENING PLANS

Australia's largest cities of Sydney and Melbourne, as well as the capital, Canberra, have been in lockdown for weeks to restrain a Delta outbreak.

The lockdown is the sixth for Victoria's capital of Melbourne, the most of any Australian city since the pandemic began.

Authorities aim to resume daily activities in Sydney and Melbourne in a staggered fashion, easing some curbs when the share of fully vaccinated adults in the population reaches 70%, which is expected next month.

Further relaxations will follow when the figure hits 80%.

Some 54% of people aged 16 and above are fully vaccinated in the most populous state of New South Wales and 45% in the southeastern state of Victoria.

Victoria recorded 628 new infections on Wednesday, the year's biggest one-day rise, exceeding the previous high of 603 a day before. New South Wales, whose capital is Sydney, had a total of 1,035 new infections, up from 1,022 on Tuesday.

Australia's tally of infections stands at about 90,300, including 1,186 deaths, with eight new deaths reported.

Cuban protests risk exacerbating COVID-19 spike - PAHO,"People walk during protests against and in support of the government, amidst the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak, in Havana, Cuba July 11, 2021. REUTERS/Stringer /File Photo

July 14 (Reuters) - Protests in Cuba will increase the risk of COVID-19 transmission because of an already high level of cases and the more contagious Delta variant, health officials said on Wednesday.

The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) urged Cubans and tourists visiting the Caribbean nation to avoid crowds, wear masks and frequently wash hands.

""The gathering of individuals for protests... increases the risk of transmission, in particular in cases such as Cuba where you have active transmission in many areas over the last week and 34,244 new cases reported,"" said Dr. Ciro Ugarte, PAHO's director of health emergencies. (Graphic on global cases)

He said in northern Matanzas province, the more contagious Delta variant had been identified and cases were rising exponentially. The area is also popular with tourists, he noted.

Since Sunday, thousands in the Communist-run country have protested against a deep economic crisis that has seen shortages of basic goods and power outages. They were also protesting against the government's handling of the coronavirus pandemic and curbs on civil liberties. read more

Cuba's government has said the demonstrations were orchestrated by the United States and blamed the decades-old U.S. trade embargo for shortages.

PAHO Director Carissa Etienne said COVID-19 cases in the Americas were down 20%, but infections were spiking in some parts of the United States, Mexico, El Salvador, Guatemala, Cuba, the British Virgin Islands, Argentina and Colombia.

She said without access to vaccines, the virus would ravage Latin America ""for years to come.""

Only one in seven people in Latin America and the Caribbean have been fully protected against COVID, she noted, with Paraguay and Jamaica inoculating less than 3% of their populations so far, and Honduras and Guatemala yet to protect even 1%. (Graphic on global vaccinations)

Ugarte said Cuba had given more than 3 million people at least one dose of its home-grown vaccines, or 27% of the population. He said PAHO understood the vaccine's efficacy in trials stood at between 91% and 92% but that final data on its effectiveness among the population would be key.

Kazakh president gives shoot-to-kill order to quell protests,"Summary

Summary Companies Dozens killed in worst violence since independence

Russian-led body says peacekeeping force to number 2,500

Fuel price protest swelled into anti-government movement

ALMATY, Jan 7 (Reuters) - Security forces appeared to have reclaimed the streets of Kazakhstan's main city on Friday after days of violence, and the Russian-backed president said he had ordered his troops to shoot to kill to put down a countrywide uprising.

A day after Moscow sent paratroopers to help crush the insurrection, police were patrolling the debris-strewn streets of Almaty, although some gunfire could still be heard.

Dozens have died and public buildings across Kazakhstan have been ransacked and torched in the worst violence the ex-Soviet republic has experienced in 30 years of independence.

Moscow said more than 70 planes were ferrying Russian troops into Kazakhstan, and that these were now helping control Almaty's main airport, recaptured on Thursday from protesters.

The uprising has prompted a military intervention by Moscow at a time of high tension in East-West relations as Russia and the United States gear up for talks next week on the Ukraine crisis. read more

Kazakh President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev blamed foreign-trained terrorists for the unrest, without providing evidence.

""The militants have not laid down their arms, they continue to commit crimes or are preparing for them,"" Tokayev, 68, said in a televised address.

""Whoever does not surrender will be destroyed. I have given the order to law enforcement agencies and the army to shoot to kill, without warning.""

The demonstrations began as a response to a fuel price hike but swelled into a broad movement against Tokayev's government and former President Nursultan Nazarbayev.

Nazarbayev, 81, was the longest-serving ruler of any ex-Soviet state until he turned over the presidency to Tokayev in 2019. His family is widely believed to have retained influence in Nur-Sultan, the purpose-built capital that bears his name.

Russian President Vladimir Putin has discussed the situation with Tokayev in several phone calls during the crisis, the Kremlin said on Friday.

SCARED

The protesters in Almaty appeared mainly to come from the city's poor outskirts or surrounding towns and villages. The violence has come as a shock to urban Kazakhs, used to comparing their country favourably to more repressive and volatile ex-Soviet Central Asian neighbours.

""At night when we hear explosions, I am scared,"" a woman named Kuralai told Reuters. ""It hurts to know that young people are dying. This has clearly been planned ... probably our government has relaxed somewhat.""

In a state where scant political opposition is tolerated, no high-profile leaders of the protest movement have emerged to issue any formal demands.

One man who attended the first night of protests and who did not want to be identified said most of those who initially turned up wanted to ""express solidarity spontaneously"", before 100-200 ""aggressive youths"" started hurling rocks at police.

The Interior Ministry said 26 ""armed criminals"" had been ""liquidated"", while 18 police and national guard members had been killed. Those figures appeared not to have been updated since Thursday.

State TV reported more than 3,800 arrests.

Fresh gunfire could be heard on Friday near the main square in Almaty, where troops had fought protesters on Thursday. Armoured personnel carriers and troops occupied the square.

Unrest has been reported in other cities, but the internet has been shut off since Wednesday, making it difficult to determine the extent of the violence.

In Aktau, a city on the Caspian Sea in western Kazakhstan, some 500 protesters gathered peacefully on Friday in front of a government building to call for Tokayev's resignation, a witness told Reuters.

RUSSIAN INFLUENCE

Moscow's swift deployment demonstrated Putin's readiness to use force to maintain influence in the former Soviet Union, at a time when he has also alarmed the West by massing troops near Ukraine, whose Crimean peninsula Russia seized in 2014.

The mission falls under the umbrella of the Collective Security Treaty Organization, comprising Russia and five ex-Soviet allies. Moscow said its force would number about 2,500.

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Friday reiterated Washington's concerns about the situation in Kazakhstan and the involvement of Russian-led forces.

""It would seem to me that the Kazakh authorities and government certainly have the capacity to deal appropriately with protests ... so it's not clear why they feel the need for any outside assistance,"" he told reporters.

Tokayev's administration said the Russians had not been engaged in combat or the ""elimination of militants"".

Mukhtar Ablyazov, an exiled ex-banker and cabinet minister turned opponent of the government, told Reuters the West must counter Russia's moves, or watch Putin rebuild ""a structure like the Soviet Union"". read more

Kazakhstan's other major neighbour, China, has backed Tokayev. State television said President Xi Jinping had told him Beijing opposed any use of force to destabilise Kazakhstan.

Nazarbayev has not been seen or heard since the protests began, though Belarus's state news agency said President Alexander Lukashenko, another close Putin ally, spoke by phone with the former Kazakh leader on Friday. read more

Tokayev removed Nazarbayev and his nephew from security posts on Wednesday.

Kazakhstan is a major oil producer and the world's top miner of uranium. Global oil prices rose on Friday, fuelled by supply worries. read more

Protests erupt in Jordan after COVID-19 hospital deaths scandal,"FILE PHOTO: Police officers stand outside the new Salt government hospital in the city of Salt, Jordan March 13, 2021. REUTERS/Muath Freij

AMMAN (Reuters) - Protests erupted across many of Jordan’s cities and provincial towns against the government’s coronavirus restrictions, a day after oxygen ran out at a state hospital leading to the deaths of at least six COVID-19 patients, witnesses said on Sunday.

Hundreds of people spilled into the streets in defiance of a night curfew in the northern city of Irbid and several other provincial cities including a neighbourhood in the capital and the city of Salt. Protesters also gathered further south in Karak city and the port city of Aqaba.

“Down with the government. We don’t fear coronavirus,” hundreds of youths chanted in Irbid where outrage at the hospital scandal combined with anger over tighter restrictions that include extending a night curfew to stem a major surge of infections driven by a more contagious variant of the virus.

Jordan’s economy has been particularly hard hit by the shutdowns aimed at containing the virus with unemployment surging to a record 24 % and poverty deepening. It witnessed its worst contraction in decades last year.

Demonstrators who blamed the government for worsening economic conditions also called for an end to draconian emergency laws enacted at the start of the pandemic last year used to limit civil and political rights.

Prime Minister Bisher al Khasawneh fired the health minister and said he bore full responsibility for the initial deaths of six coronavirus patients that exposed gross negligence in the state health system when medical staff failed to act after oxygen ran out for two hours.

King Abdullah visited the hospital in Salt, a city west of the Jordanian capital of Amman, in a move officials said was intended to defuse tensions. Anger with the authorities over worsening living standards, corruption has in the past triggered civil unrest in Jordan.

The authorities detained the hospital head and their aides Saturday evening with officials saying another three deaths could be linked to the rupture in oxygen supplies.

“I am here because of the catastrophe. We want to put on trial those responsible for this and then bring down the government,” said Ahmad Hiyari, a demonstrator near Salt hospital among hundreds of angry residents.",2021-03-14 19:43:05,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-jordan-protests-idUSKBN2B60QY,17
"Jordan police detain scores of activists, break up protests","AMMAN (Reuters) - Jordanian riot police on Wednesday broke up protests in Amman and other cities called to mark the 10th anniversary of Arab Spring pro-democracy demonstrations, and authorities detained tens of activists, witnesses said.

Police in Amman handcuffed several people who defied a government ban on protests and rounded up others who approached the Dakhiliya roundabout, witnesses said. There was heavy security presence, and dozens of anti-riot vehicles encircled the major artery to stop any gathering.

“This is Jordanian democracy,” shouted one of the protesters. Other activists demanded an end to emergency laws introduced with the COVID-19 pandemic last year, which civic groups say violate civil and political rights.

Witnesses said small protests were broken up in several cities across the country and prominent activists were arrested.

Jordan’s disparate opposition groups had called for a large demonstration in Dakhiliya roundabout, the site of large protests in 2011 demanding regime change during the Arab Spring that shook governments from Tunisia to the Gulf.

Those Jordanian protests later turned violent, and one protester was killed and dozens injured in clashes between demonstrators and police.

Several years of sweeping pro-democracy protests, led by Islamists and tribal and leftist opposition groups, followed as they sought limits on King Abdullah’s powers and wider political freedoms.

The government, which has in recent years clamped down on dissent, this month used tear gas to break up nationwide protests after hundreds of demonstrators took to the streets, angered by an extended pandemic curfew.[L8N2LD6TN]

Interior Minister Mazen al Faraya said the kingdom would not tolerate protests that would worsen the health crisis.

Despite growing frustration, King Abdullah and his Hashemite dynasty enjoy solid public support, and the king acts as a unifiying force among native Jordanian tribes and Jordanian Palestinians.

"Afghan protests persist, posing a problem for new Taliban government","Afghan demonstrators shout slogans during an anti-Pakistan protest, near the Pakistan embassy in Kabul, Afghanistan, September 7, 2021. REUTERS/Stringer

Sept 7 (Reuters) - A group of Afghan women crouched on the side of a Kabul street and took cover after armed members of the Taliban fired shots into the air to disperse hundreds of protesters.

One of them spoke rapidly at the camera filming them.

""These people (the Taliban) are very unjust, and they are not human at all,"" she said. ""They do not give us the right to demonstrate; they are not Muslims but infidels.""

Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register

Heavy gunfire resumed, leading to more panic.

There were no known casualties from the firing, and video footage from Tuesday's protests, some of it shared on social media, showed Taliban pointing their rifles in the air before they pull the trigger.

But the protests, nearly a month after the Taliban seized control of Kabul, along with daily, smaller demonstrations around the country often led by women, pose a challenge to the new Afghan government announced late on Tuesday.

The hardline Islamist group has urged Afghans to be patient, allowing it time to form a government before it addresses people's demands.

""They were asked to be a little patient and when the system has been established and the organisations are functioning then they will get back to you,"" a Taliban spokesperson said this week, referring to women protesters.

Now ministers have been named, the expectations of a society where civil rights have been strengthened over the last two decades are only likely to grow.

The last time the Taliban ruled Afghanistan, from 1996-2001, girls could not attend school and women were banned from work and education. Religious police would flog anyone breaking the rules, and public executions were carried out.

The group has promised to be more tolerant this time - a commitment many Afghans and foreign donors will be monitoring closely.

Protesters' demands vary.

Female students in the western city of Herat said they would lobby loudly for greater representation in the new government and for their rights to be respected.

""Women have to come out to save our jobs and status in society. It is really now or never situation,"" said Dariya Imani, a student at a business school at Herat University.

She said her cousins were part of the protest in Kabul today.

""We are not brave, we are just desperate to protect our basic rights,"" Imani said.

Taliban leaders have vowed to honour women's rights in accordance with sharia, or Islamic law. But they also indicated there would not be any women among senior government positions, and none have been announced so far.

On Tuesday, men and women also denounced what they see as Pakistan's guiding hand behind the Taliban - support that Islamabad denies.

Some referenced the only remaining armed resistance to the Taliban - fighters in the Panjshir Valley north of Kabul who have been dislodged from the main towns but who have vowed to carry on fighting from their mountain hideouts.

Sudanese security forces fire tear gas to disperse latest round of protests,"Protesters march during a rally against military rule following last month's coup in Khartoum, Sudan December 30, 2021. REUTERS/Mohamed Nureldin Abdallah/File Photo

KHARTOUM, Jan 4 (Reuters) - Security forces fired tear gas to disperse large crowds demonstrating against military rule and recent protester deaths across the Sudanese capital Khartoum and neighbouring cities on Tuesday, eyewitnesses told Reuters.

The demonstrations, the 13th round of protests since a military coup on Oct. 25, were called by a local ""resistance committee"" in Khartoum's twin city of Omdurman in response to the killing of several protesters there on Thursday and Sunday.

They come two days after the resignation of Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok, who had served from 2019 until the coup and was reinstated on Nov. 21 in an agreement with the military widely rejected by protesters. read more

Some 57 people have been killed in protests against military rule since October, according to medics.

In recent weeks, protesters have aimed for the presidential palace in Khartoum, with crowds from Omdurman and Bahri, across the Nile from Khartoum, attempting to cross bridges.

In response, the military on Tuesday blocked several bridges and main roads. Resistance committees organising the protests directed them away from bridges.

In Khartoum, a Reuters witness saw security forces, some armed with sticks and guns, fighting running battles with scattered protesters in an area of open ground as they approached the palace. They fired rounds of tear gas and stun grenades, some of which protesters tried to throw back.

Protesters in Omdurman said they faced heavy tear gas at two focal points for the rallies, and that security forces chased protesters in vehicles and on foot past sunset. One protester, who asked to remain anonymous due to ongoing arrests, said he saw a home set on fire after a tear gas canister landed on it.

Images shared on social media also showed protests in the cities of Port Sudan, El Obeid and Nyala. Internet and phone connections were not cut, as they have been on other protest days. Another protest is set for Thursday.

In his resignation speech, Hamdok said he had tried and failed to bring disparate forces together to agree on a path forward for the transition that began with the toppling of Omar al-Bashir in April 2019.

In a statement on Wednesday, military leader General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan said the door was open to all political forces and revolutionary youth to come to an agreement on completing the transition.

The United States, Britain, Norway and the European Union warned in a statement on Tuesday that they would not support a unilaterally appointed government and that a nationally inclusive dialogue was needed. A credible government and parliament were necessary to facilitate renewed economic assistance, the statement read.

""In the absence of progress, we would look to accelerate efforts to hold those actors impeding the democratic process accountable,"" it said. read more

""Every day we're here waiting for some sort of policy for us but nothing comes, so we have no choice but to stay,"" one protester said.

Uniformed security could be seen detaining at least two among about two dozen protesters and forming a circle around those who remained, locking arms so that none could leave while the two were taken away.

Security personnel responded to sporadic chants of ""Evergrande return our money"" by waving a banner that said ""police evidence"" while an officer filmed the protesters who were shouting.

During a thunderstorm, a crying woman who was sitting among remaining protesters and approaching security personnel was carried away to a nearby police van.

Earlier on Thursday, Evergrande's main unit, Hengda Real Estate Group Co Ltd, applied to suspend trading of its onshore corporate bonds following a downgrade.

On Monday, Reuters reported that about 100 protesters had crowded into the company's lobby that day to demand repayment of loans and financial products. read more

TIMELINE: Olympic torch protests around the world,"(Reuters) - The Olympic torch made its way through the streets of Pyongyang in front of flag-waving masses on Monday after North Korea promised its main benefactor China an “astonishing” show certain to be free of protest.

Demonstrations against China’s human rights record as well as patriotic rallies by Chinese who criticized the West for vilifying Beijing have marred the global torch relay.

Here is a list of disruptions.

* March 24, 2008: Human rights protesters breach security to try to disrupt the torch-lighting ceremony in Olympia, Greece, home of the ancient Olympics. Relay runners are briefly held up when several demonstrators lie in front of a convoy of cars.

* March 30: Small group of Tibet activists try to stop flame entering Athens stadium for handover to Chinese officials. The group fails to break through security cordon and is quickly removed by Greek police.

* April 6: Thousands of protesters wave Tibetan flags and shout “Shame on China” as the torch relay passes through London. One man gets his hands on the torch before being wrestled to the ground. The torch is hurried on to a double-decker bus when about 100 protesters rush towards it. At least 35 people are arrested.

* April 7: Paris officials extinguish the flame at least twice and carry the torch by bus when protesters try to seize it. The flame’s scheduled five-hour passage is cut short after thousands of protesters block its path.

* April 9: San Francisco changes torch route at the last minute, wrong-footing thousands of protesters and counter-protesters lining the original planned route through the city, where a fifth of the population is ethnically Chinese.

* April 17: Thousands of exiled Tibetans take part in a parallel relay, as the torch is paraded in New Delhi. A security cordon of 15,000 Indian police and guards keeps protesters far from the route, which was cut by a third.

* April 19: In Bangkok, about 200 China supporters taunt scores of pro-Tibet demonstrators as police man barricades to protect the torch on its route beginning in the city’s China Town.

* April 24: More than 10,000 Chinese Australians stage the biggest pro-Beijing rally of the relay in Canberra. Chinese six-deep line the 16-km (10-mile) route, while hundreds of cars drive around the city carrying Chinese flags.

April 26: Chinese students scuffle with pro-Tibet protesters and Japanese nationalists during the relay through Nagano. Four Chinese supporters are injured and five men arrested.

* April 27: Thousands of Chinese outnumber South Koreans along the flame’s route in Seoul. At one point, the two groups clash, with Chinese students kicking an elderly South Korean protester and hurling rocks at a group that raised banners chastising Beijing. More than 8,000 police guard the route.

Special Report: Iran’s leader ordered crackdown on unrest - 'Do whatever it takes to end it',"(Reuters) - After days of protests across Iran last month, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei appeared impatient. Gathering his top security and government officials together, he issued an order: Do whatever it takes to stop them.

That order, confirmed by three sources close to the supreme leader’s inner circle and a fourth official, set in motion the bloodiest crackdown on protesters since the Islamic Revolution in 1979.

About 1,500 people were killed during less than two weeks of unrest that started on Nov. 15. The toll, provided to Reuters by three Iranian interior ministry officials, included at least 17 teenagers and about 400 women as well as some members of the security forces and police.

The toll of 1,500 is significantly higher than figures from international human rights groups and the United States. A Dec. 16 report by Amnesty International said the death toll was at least 304. The U.S. State Department, in a statement to Reuters, said it estimates that many hundreds of Iranians were killed, and has seen reports that number could be over 1,000.

The figures provided to Reuters, said two of the Iranian officials who provided them, are based on information gathered from security forces, morgues, hospitals and coroner’s offices.

The government spokesman’s office declined to comment on whether the orders came from Khamenei and on the Nov. 17 meeting. Iran’s mission to the United Nations did not respond to a request for comment for this story.

In a statement Monday following publication of this article, a spokesman for Iran’s Supreme National Security Council described the death toll figure as “fake news,” according to semi-official Tasnim news agency.

What began as scattered protests over a surprise increase in gasoline prices quickly spread into one of the biggest challenges to Iran’s clerical rulers since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.

By Nov. 17, the second day, the unrest had reached the capital Tehran, with people calling for an end to the Islamic Republic and the downfall of its leaders. Protesters burned pictures of Khamenei and called for the return of Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of the toppled Shah of Iran, according to videos posted on social media and eye witnesses.

That evening at his official residence in a fortified compound in central Tehran, Khamenei met with senior officials, including security aides, President Hassan Rouhani and members of his cabinet.

At the meeting, described to Reuters by the three sources close to his inner circle, the 80-year-old leader, who has final say over all state matters in the country, raised his voice and expressed criticism of the handling of the unrest. He was also angered by the burning of his image and the destruction of a statue of the republic’s late founder, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.

“The Islamic Republic is in danger. Do whatever it takes to end it. You have my order,” the supreme leader told the group, one of the sources said.

Khamenei said he would hold the assembled officials responsible for the consequences of the protests if they didn’t immediately stop them. Those who attended the meeting agreed the protesters aimed to bring down the regime.

“The enemies wanted to topple the Islamic Republic and immediate reaction was needed,” one of the sources said.

The fourth official, who was briefed on the Nov. 17 meeting, added that Khamenei made clear the demonstrations required a forceful response.

“Our Imam,” said the official, referring to Khamenei, “only answers to God. He cares about people and the Revolution. He was very firm and said those rioters should be crushed.”

Tehran’s clerical rulers have blamed “thugs” linked to the regime’s opponents in exile and the country’s main foreign foes, namely the United States, Israel and Saudi Arabia, for stirring up unrest. Khamenei has described the unrest as the work of a “very dangerous conspiracy.”

A Dec. 3 report on Iran’s state television confirmed that security forces had fatally shot citizens, saying “some rioters were killed in clashes.” Iran has given no official death toll and has rejected figures as “speculative.”

“The aim of our enemies was to endanger the existence of the Islamic Republic by igniting riots in Iran,” said the commander-in-chief of the elite Revolutionary Guards Corps, Hossein Salami, last month, according to Iranian media.

The Revolutionary Guards declined to comment for this report.

Iran’s interior minister said on Nov. 27 more than 140 government sites had been set on fire along with hundreds of banks and dozens of petrol stations, while 50 bases used by security forces were also attacked, according to remarks reported by Iran’s state news agency IRNA. The minister said up to 200,000 people took part in the unrest nationwide.

“SMELL OF GUNFIRE AND SMOKE”

For decades, Islamic Iran has tried to expand its influence across the Middle East, from Syria to Iraq and Lebanon, by investing Tehran’s political and economic capital and backing militias. But now it faces pressure at home and abroad.

In recent months, from the streets of Baghdad to Beirut, protesters have been voicing anger at Tehran, burning its flag and chanting anti-Iranian regime slogans. At home, the daily struggle to make ends meet has worsened since the United States reimposed sanctions after withdrawing last year from the nuclear deal that Iran negotiated with world powers in 2015.

The protests erupted after a Nov. 15 announcement on state media that gas prices would rise by as much as 200% and the revenue would be used to help needy families.

Within hours, hundreds of people poured into the streets in places including the northeastern city of Mashhad, the southeastern province of Kerman and the southwestern province of Khuzestan bordering Iraq, according to state media. That night, a resident of the city Ahvaz in Khuzestan described the scene by telephone to Reuters.

“Riot police are out in force and blocking main streets,” the source said. “I heard shooting.” Videos later emerged on social media and state television showing footage of clashes in Ahvaz and elsewhere between citizens and security forces.

The protests reached more than 100 cities and towns and turned political. Young and working-class demonstrators demanded clerical leaders step down. In many cities, a similar chant rang out: “They live like kings, people get poorer,” according to videos on social media and witnesses.

By Nov. 18 in Tehran, riot police appeared to be randomly shooting at protesters in the street “with the smell of gunfire and smoke everywhere,” said a female Tehran resident reached by telephone. People were falling down and shouting, she added, while others sought refuge in houses and shops.

The mother of a 16-year-old boy described holding his body, drenched in blood, after he was shot during protests in a western Iranian town on Nov. 19. Speaking on condition of anonymity, she described the scene in a telephone interview.

“I heard people saying: ‘He is shot, he is shot,’” said the mother. “I ran toward the crowd and saw my son, but half of his head was shot off.” She said she urged her son, whose first name was Amirhossein, not to join the protests, but he didn’t listen.

Iranian authorities deployed lethal force at a far quicker pace from the start than in other protests in recent years, according to activists and details revealed by authorities. In 2009, when millions protested against the disputed re-election of hardline President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, an estimated 72 people were killed. And when Iran faced waves of protests over economic hardships in 2017 and 2018, the death toll was about 20 people, officials said.

Khamenei, who has ruled Iran for three decades, turned to his elite forces to put down the recent unrest -- the Revolutionary Guards and its affiliated Basij religious militia.

A senior member of the Revolutionary Guards in western Kermanshah province said the provincial governor handed down instructions at a late-night emergency meeting at his office on Nov. 18.

“We had orders from top officials in Tehran to end the protests, the Guards member said, recounting the governor’s talk. “No more mercy. They are aiming to topple the Islamic Republic. But we will eradicate them.” The governor’s office declined to comment.

As security forces fanned out across the country, security advisors briefed Khamenei on the scale of the unrest, according to the three sources familiar with the talks at his compound.

The interior minister presented the number of casualties and arrests. The intelligence minister and head of the Revolutionary Guards focused on the role of opposition groups. When asked about the interior and intelligence minister’s role in the meeting, the government spokesman’s office declined to comment.

Khamenei, the three sources said, was especially concerned with anger in small working-class towns, whose lower-income voters have been a pillar of support for the Islamic Republic. Their votes will count in February parliamentary elections, a litmus test of the clerical rulers’ popularity since U.S. President Donald Trump exited Iran’s nuclear deal -- a step that has led to an 80% collapse in Iran’s oil exports since last year.

Squeezed by sanctions, Khamenei has few resources to tackle high inflation and unemployment. According to official figures, the unemployment rate is around 12.5% overall. But it is about double that for Iran’s millions of young people, who accuse the establishment of economic mismanagement and corruption. Khamenei and other officials have called on the judiciary to step up its fight against corruption.

“BLOOD ON THE STREETS”

Officials in four provinces said the message was clear -- failure to stamp out the unrest would encourage people to protest in the future.

A local official in Karaj, a working-class city near the capital, said there were orders to use whatever force was necessary to end the protests immediately. “Orders came from Tehran,” he said, speaking on condition of anonymity. “Push them back to their homes, even by shooting them.” Local government officials declined to comment.

Residents of Karaj said they came under fire from rooftops as Revolutionary Guards and police on motorcycles brandished machine guns. “There was blood everywhere. Blood on the streets,” said one resident by telephone. Reuters could not independently verify that account.

In Mahshahr county, in the strategically important Khuzestan province in southwest Iran, Revolutionary Guards in armored vehicles and tanks sought to contain the demonstrations. State TV said security forces opened fire on “rioters” hiding in the marshes. Rights groups said they believe Mahshahr had one of the highest protest death tolls in Iran, based on what they heard from locals.

“The next day when we went there, the area was full of bodies of protesters, mainly young people. The Guards did not let us take the bodies,” the local official said, estimating that “dozens” were killed.

The U.S. State Department has said it has received videos of the Revolutionary Guards opening fire without warning on protesters in Mahshahr. And that when protesters fled to nearby marshlands, the Guards pursued them and surrounded them with machine guns mounted on trucks, spraying the protesters with bullets and killing at least 100 Iranians.

Iran’s authorities dispute the U.S. account. Iranian officials have said security forces in Mahshahr confronted “rioters” who they described as a security threat to petrochemical complexes and to a key energy route that, if blocked, would have created a crisis in the country.

A security official told Reuters that the reports about Mahshahr are “exaggerated and not true” and that security forces were defending “people and the country’s energy facilities in the city from sabotage by enemies and rioters.”

In Isfahan, an ancient city of two million people in central Iran, the government’s vow to help low-income families with money raised from higher gas prices failed to reassure people like Behzad Ebrahimi. He said his 21-year-old nephew, Arshad Ebrahimi, was fatally shot during the crackdown.

“Initially they refused to give us the body and wanted us to bury him with others killed in the protests,” Ebrahimi said. “Eventually we buried him ourselves, but under the heavy presence of security forces.” Rights activists confirmed the events. Reuters was unable to get comment from the government or the local governor on the specifics of the account.",2019-12-23 04:07:03,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iran-protests-specialreport-idUSKBN1YR0QR,23
"Three people shot dead during huge protests against Sudan coup, doctors say","Summary Thousands of protesters call for an end to military rule

Tight security in capital Khartoum

Burhan said he removed cabinet to avert civil war

KHARTOUM, Oct 30 (Reuters) - Security forces shot dead three people during nationwide protests in Sudan on Saturday, a doctors committee said, as hundreds of thousands of people demanded the restoration of a civilian-led government after a military coup.

In Khartoum, security forces used tear gas and gunfire to try to disperse a huge crowd after protesters had been setting up a stage and discussing the possibility of a sit-in, said a Reuters witness.

The Central Committee of Sudanese Doctors said three protesters were shot dead by security forces in the capital Khartoum's twin city of Omdurman. It said 38 people were injured, including some by gunfire.

An eyewitness in Omdurman said they heard gunshots and saw people being carried away bleeding from the direction of the parliament building.

Sudanese police denied shooting protesters during the demonstrations, saying on state TV that one policeman sustained gunshot wounds. A representative of the military was not immediately available to comment.

The demonstrations marked the biggest challenge to General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan since he ousted Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok's cabinet on Monday.

""This has been a miscalculation from the start and misunderstanding of the level of commitment, bravery, and concern the street has about the future of Sudan,"" said Jonas Horner of the International Crisis Group.

Protesters carried Sudanese flags and chanted ""Military rule can't be praised"" and ""This country is ours, and our government is civilian"" as they marched in neighbourhoods across Khartoum.

People also took to the streets in cities in central, eastern, northern and western Sudan. Crowds swelled to the hundreds of thousands in Khartoum, said a Reuters witness.

""The people have delivered their message, that retreat is impossible and power belongs to the people,"" said protester Haitham Mohamed.

AID FROZEN

The United States and the World Bank have frozen assistance to Sudan, where an economic crisis has seen shortages of food and medicine and where nearly a third of the population are in need of urgent humanitarian support.

While Western states have denounced the coup, Sudan's regional allies Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt have emphasized the need for stability and security.

Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud told Reuters that the kingdom hopes all sides in Sudan can engage in a dialogue and chart a path forward.

Civilian-appointed cabinet ministers supported the protests in a statement, and said the military ""will not find free Sudanese or true democratic revolutionary forces to be their partners in power.""

In central Khartoum there was a heavy military deployment of armed troops that included the army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces.

Security forces had blocked roads leading to the defence ministry complex and the airport.

With Saturday's daths, at least 14 protesters have been killed in clashes with security forces this week, raising fears of a full-blown crackdown.

In local neighbourhoods, protest groups blocked roads overnight with stones, bricks, tree branches and plastic pipes to try to keep the security forces out.

NEIGHBOURHOOD RESISTANCE COMMITTEES

Unlike in previous protests, many people carried pictures of Hamdok, who remains popular despite an economic crisis that had worsened under his rule.

""Hamdok is supported by the people. If Hamdok takes the country that's okay,"" said Mohamed, a member of a neighbourhood resistance committee.

With internet and phone lines restricted by the authorities, opponents of the coup mobilised for the protest using fliers, SMS messages, graffiti, and neighbourhood rallies.

Neighbourhood-based resistance committees, active since the uprising against deposed President Omar al-Bashir that began in December 2018, have been central to organising despite the arrests of key politicians.

Protesters carried pictures of Burhan, his deputy General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, and Bashir covered in red.

Burhan has said he removed the cabinet to avert civil war after civilian politicians stoked hostility to the armed forces.

He says he is still committed to a democratic transition, including elections in July 2023.

""Rule is based on a combination of consent and coercion,"" said Sudanese analyst Magdi El Gizouli. ""Burhan has no consent and is unable to coerce the multitudes on the street into submission.""

Summary Omanis protest for third consecutive day

Protests pose challenge for new sultan

Oman introduced new tax to fix state finances

Markets unaffected, Oman CDS unchanged

DUBAI, May 25 (Reuters) - Groups of Omanis demanding jobs held fresh protests on Tuesday, activists said, in the biggest challenge yet to the Gulf state's new ruler, who ordered the government to accelerate plans to create thousands of jobs.

Social media postings showed a group of protesters holding a sit-in under a bridge in the northern city of Sohar, where protests have taken place for three consecutive days. Other protests were reported in several other towns, including Rustaq, Nizwa and Sur.

Videos and photos showed security forces serving water to protesters, a change of approach from Monday's demonstrations when police fired tear gas to disperse gatherings and arrested groups of protesters. read more

Sultan Haitham, who acceded to the throne last year after the death of Sultan Qaboos, has had to bring in austerity measures to ease pressure on public finances at a time of low oil prices.

The government did not comment on Tuesday's protests. Oman's state television showed the sultan chairing a meeting on youth employment.

""The youth are the nation's wealth, its unfailing resource ... We will make sure we listen to them, sense their needs, interests and aspirations,"" Sultan Haitham said.

The sultan also announced new directives to create up to 32,000 full and part-time government jobs, according to Oman's state news agency. These will include government subsidies for those entering the workforce for the first time.

The economy of Oman, a relatively small energy producer with high levels of debt, is vulnerable to swings in oil prices and external shocks such as the coronavirus pandemic.

The protests follow the introduction last month of a value-added tax (VAT) for the first time, one of a series of reforms aimed at ensuring the sultanate’s financial sustainability.

Oman has pushed forward its programme of replacing foreign workers with Omani citizens to ease pressure on the job market but youth unemployment is relatively high at over 10%.

""The authorities may choose to postpone the implementation of some of the planned fiscal measures to maintain socioeconomic stability, especially if oil prices rise enough to reduce pressure on the budget,"" said Zahabia Gupta, an analyst at S&P Global Ratings.

The International Monetary Fund has estimated Oman's gross external debt will go down to around 112% of gross domestic product this year from 127% of GDP last year.

Rachna Uppal, director of research at Azure Strategy, said Oman has committed to diversifying its income stream away from hydrocarbons but there are headwinds on the horizon.

""The slow pace of reforms and increased austerity measures combined with the ongoing uncertainty over the pandemic is testing popular patience ... if protests continue or spread wider, it could spook investors at a critical time for Oman,"" she said.

Markets so far appeared to have shrugged off the protests, with Oman credit default swaps – a measure of sovereign default risk – unchanged on Tuesday, according to IHS Markit data.

""Seeing where oil prices are and Oman’s move early in the year to fund the deficit - it already raised $4.35 billion out of its $5 billion external funding need – there are no major concerns in the market"" said Zeina Rizk, a fixed income fund manager at Dubai-based Arqaam Capital.

"Mexicans protest journalist killings, call for protection","MEXICO CITY, Jan 25 (Reuters) - Mexican journalists on Tuesday started nationwide protests to denounce the recent murders of three reporters, demanding an end to impunity that has often characterized the killings of their colleagues.

The protests follow the murder of seasoned journalist Lourdes Maldonado on Sunday, some three years after she raised the issue of killings with President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador and said she feared for her life. read more

Protesters in the central state of Puebla laid flowers and candles on the street along with signs that read ""I'm angry at censorship"", television footage showed, while in the northern state of Chihuahua protesters scrawled on a wall ""Journalism is a risk"" and drew the face of Maldonado.

Israel Ibarra, president at a Baja California communications college, said if government and society failed to act they would be ""complicit"" not only in the murders of Maldonado and others but ""the murder of freedom of expression in Mexico"".

Mexico is one of the world's most dangerous countries for journalists, and some 145 have been killed between 2000-2021, according to Article 19, an advocacy group.

Mexican journalist networks voted to stage the gatherings, which will coincide with online protest campaigns.

""It is matter of urgency that state and federal authorities prevent attacks, protect journalists when they are victims, and investigate crimes committed against the press with due diligence,"" Article 19 said in a statement.

Maldonado's murder in the northern border city of Tijuana, where she worked for many years, followed the killings of two other Mexican journalists this month.

Lopez Obrador, who has been criticized for not doing more to protect reporters, said his government would investigate and ""clear up this crime to prevent further murders of journalists"".

Critics say Lopez Obrador has failed to deliver on pledges to reduce violence, combat deeply entrenched organized crime, or reduce impunity. The president says crime and violence are the products of chronic corruption and inequality.

"Thousands protest in Belgrade, demand government action to stop pollution","BELGRADE, April 10 (Reuters) - Several thousand people blocked traffic in front of the Serbian parliament on Saturday in a protest against lack of government action to prevent water, land and air pollution by industries such as the mining sector.

Protesters, who came to Belgrade from all over Serbia, held banners reading ""Cut corruption and crime not forests,"" and ""Young people are leaving because they cannot breathe"".

In recent years Serbia has started selling its mining resources to foreign companies, despite opposition by local residents who had warned that increased ore exploration could cause greater pollution.

The former Yuoslav republic, which in the 1990s went through a decade of wars and economic crisis, has lacked resources to tackle pollution. As it seeks to join the European Union, Serbia will need billions of euros of investment to meet the bloc's environmental standards.

Aleksandar Jovanovic, one of the protest leaders, told the crowd that investors were all welcome in the country, but added, ""But you cannot poison our children.""

""None of the people who have power care about anything else but money, they don't care about ecology,"" one protester, who gave his name only as Marjan and who had driven from the town of Jagodina, 140 kilometres (90 miles) from Belgrade, told Reuters.

India's use of facial recognition tech during protests causes stir,"MUMBAI/NEW DELHI, India (Reuters) - When artist Rachita Taneja heads out to protest in New Delhi, she covers her face with a pollution mask, a hoodie or a scarf to reduce the risk of being identified by police facial recognition software.

Police in the Indian capital and the northern state of Uttar Pradesh - both hotbeds of dissent - have used the technology during protests that have raged since mid-December against a new citizenship law that critics say marginalises Muslims.

Activists are worried about insufficient regulation around the new technology, amid what they say is a crackdown on dissent under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, whose Hindu nationalist agenda has gathered pace since his re-election in May.

“I do not know what they are going to do with my data,” said Taneja, 28, who created a popular online cartoon about cheap ways for protesters to hide their faces. “We need to protect ourselves, given how this government cracks down.”

Critics also accuse authorities of secrecy - highlighting, for instance, that the software’s use during Delhi protests was first revealed by the Indian Express newspaper.

India’s home ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment on facial recognition technology.

Modi’s government has rejected accusations of abuse during demonstrations, and accused some protesters of stoking violence.

A spokesman for his ruling Bharatiya Janata Party had no immediate comment on concerns over the use of the technology and referred questions to the government.

But police said worries about facial recognition were unwarranted.

“I’m only catching targeted people,” said Rajan Bhagat, a deputy commissioner of police at Delhi’s Crime Records Office. “We don’t have any protesters’ data, nor do we plan to store it.”

He declined to give details of potential arrests, however.

When it comes to surveillance, India trails far behind neighboring China. New Delhi, for example, has about 0.9 CCTV cameras for every 100 people, versus about 11.3 per 100 in China’s commercial hub of Shanghai, a 2019 report by PreciseSecurity.com showed.

The Delhi police use Indian startup Innefu Labs’ facial recognition software AI Vision, which also includes gait and body analysis.

“If somebody is throwing stones at a police officer, doesn’t he have a right to take a video and identify him?” said Innefu co-founder Tarun Wig, 36.

Police in about 10 Indian states use Innefu products, Wig said.

Financial fraud analytics are among the services provided by Innefu, which published a social media analysis in January that concluded much criticism of the new citizenship law came from archenemy Pakistan to “destabilize the harmony” of India.

The company is representative of homegrown artificial intelligence startups tapping into booming demand for facial biometrics in India, in part thanks to their testing on Indian faces and more affordable prices.

A few established foreign firms, such as Japanese telecommunications and IT giant NEC Corp, also operate in India, where the market is expected to grow from about $700 million in 2018 to more than $4 billion by 2024, TechSci Research said in a report.

UTTAR PRADESH ARRESTS

Facial recognition helped police in Uttar Pradesh, home to 220 million people, detain a “handful” of the more than 1,100 people arrested for alleged links to violence during protests, said O P Singh, its police chief who retired last month.

Singh gave no details but said the technology helped cut the numbers of wrongful arrests and highlighted the state’s extensive database of more than 550,000 “criminals”.

Rights groups have decried what they call excessive force in Uttar Pradesh, which has the largest number of representatives in parliament and is governed by hardline Hindu priest and Modi ally Yogi Adityanath.

The state says tough policies have restored order.

Startup Staqu is supplying its product, the Police Artificial Intelligence System, to police in eight states, including Uttar Pradesh, says the firm’s co-founder, Atul Rai.

Fears of mass surveillance in India were exaggerated, said Rai, 30, citing difficulties in collecting information because of India’s large population of 1.3 billion. But there was a need for regulation to avoid potential problems, he added.

Police should have clear rules on use of facial recognition technology and there should be disclosure of the software’s audits and algorithms, the non-profit Internet Freedom Foundation says.

“What India is seeing is a kind of personal data Wild West,” said its executive director Apar Gupta.

PAN-INDIA FACIAL RECOGNITION

Law enforcement across India could soon be using facial recognition technology.

Modi’s government is seeking bids to create a nationwide database, the National Automated Facial Recognition System, to help match images captured from CCTV cameras with existing databases, including those of passport and police authorities.

A foreign firm is expected to win the contract, since the bid terms require firms’ algorithms to be evaluated by the United States’ National Institute of Standards and Technology. Both Innefu and Staqu said they were not bidding.

Japanese firm NEC’s India subsidiary helped develop the Aadhaar biometrics identity system and supplies facial recognition technology to law enforcement in the diamond industry hub of Surat in western Gujarat state.

The software has not been used during protests, however, the city’s police commissioner, R B Brahmbhatt, told Reuters.

NEC spokesman Shinya Hashizume declined to comment on whether the company was bidding to build the nationwide database.

The system will boost police efficiency, says the National Crime Records Bureau, which launched the tender that closes at the end of March.

But critics say it puts India on the path to China-style mass surveillance.

Worried about being identified, a 21-year-old Muslim protester in New Delhi has adopted the pseudonym Moosa Ali and sometimes covers his face with handkerchiefs.

“We don’t know enough about these things, but we are trying to take some precautions,” he said.",2020-02-17 05:45:44,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-india-citizenship-protests-technology-idUSKBN20B0ZQ,28
Rio Tinto-led plan for major lithium mine stirs protests in Serbia,"""No mine, yes life"", says the poster displayed along the roadside in the village of Gornje Nedeljice, where the company Rio Tinto plans to build an underground mine for the exploitation of jadarite, in Serbia, August 9, 2021.

KORENITA, Serbia, Aug 26 (Reuters) - Four years from now, fields in the Jadar river valley in western Serbia where Djorjde Kapetanovic grows corn and soy to feed his cattle will be turned into a waste dump for Europe's biggest lithium mine.

Rio Tinto (RIO.L) in July committed $2.4 billion to its Jadar project as global miners push into metals needed for the green energy transition, including lithium, which is used to make electric vehicle batteries. The Jadar project, once completed, would help make Rio a top 10 lithium producer, just as demand for EVs booms.

Opposition to the project is growing, however, because of concerns about possible environmental damage and protest rallies have become more frequent. In April, thousands gathered in Belgrade to protest against widespread pollution in the Balkan country and against the lithium mine near Loznica, 142 km (88 miles) southwest of the capital.

Once it reaches full capacity, the mine is expected to produce 58,000 tonnes of refined battery-grade lithium carbonate per year. That would make it Europe's biggest lithium mine in terms of production, Rio said.

In the village of Korenita, dairy farmer Kapetanovic said the mine, if opened, could leave him without income. Part of his land where he grows crop to feed his animals will be turned into a dump for mining waste, known as tailings, with compensation from the company.

Other areas of his land, his house and a cattle shed will be outside the mine, leaving Kapetanovic worried about exposure to possible pollution.

""Who would want to buy products made on the outskirts of the mine?"" said Kapetanovic, who produces 10 tonnes (22,000 lb) of meat and 90,000 litres (23,775 gallons) of milk per year, making him one of the bigger producers in the Loznica area.

Rio Tinto Serbia CEO Vesna Prodanovic said the Anglo-Australian miner would meet all European Union and Serbian environmental regulations, including on the treatment of wastewater.

""There's simply no way for the construction to start without securing licences (and) if all those (EU standards) are not adhered to,"" she said in an interview.

""We take into account precipitation levels, prescribed dust levels. We take into consideration everything there is in the field. We are making all studies and tests to get clear data about what is the current situation in the area.""

One study, commissioned by Rio on the mine’s environmental impact, concluded the mine should not be built as it will cause ""irredeemable damage to the biosphere"", an abstract obtained by Reuters found.

""The implementation of the planned activities, especially the disposal of industrial waste, will significantly impair biodiversity in the entire area of the planned works,"" the study by Belgrade University’s Faculty of Biology said.

""In ... primary zones of (the mine's) influence, there will be complete and direct destruction of habitats with the disappearance of all organisms that inhabit them.""

Rio said the biodiversity study was part of a wider feasibility study and it would conduct further research to ""support the most advanced and most expensive solutions in nature protection, which would minimise the impact"".

ECONOMIC BOOST

Lithium is central to the European Union's plans to secure an entire supply chain of battery minerals and materials as the use of electric vehicles increases.

Serbia, which sits on the world's 11th largest lithium reserves, is working its way through the accession process to join the EU.

For its own economy, the Jadar project is one of Serbia’s biggest foreign investments to date and could help to tackle rising unemployment in the Balkan country.

Rio said the project would create about 2,100 construction jobs and inject approximately 200 million euros ($235.32 million) per year into the domestic supply chain.

Energy minister Zorana Mihajlovic told Reuters that Serbia aimed, like the EU, to secure the entire production chain, including a potential battery plant and an electric vehicle plant.

Rio's Serbia CEO said the company's studies estimated the project would add 1 percentage point to Serbia's $51.4 billion annual GDP. It would also boost Loznica’s municipal budget by 60-70% annually, she said.

In June, Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic, who is under fire for supporting the project, said a referendum would be held to allow people to decide whether it should go ahead.

The absence of further details on the referendum has worried opponents. In July, Loznica municipal assembly, which is dominated by Vucic's Serbian Progressive Party and its allies, formally gave a green light for mine construction by approving a new municipal plan for land allocation.

Contacted by Reuters, the president's office had no immediate comment.

Rio has bought nearly half of the land required for the mine, which will be spread over roughly 387 hectares.

Some $100 million of Rio's investment has been earmarked for environmental protection, but activists say that is insufficient to compensate for potential damage.

One major concern for environmentalists is Rio's plan to put waste dumps in the Korenita and Jadar rivers valley, an area prone to flash flooding.

In 2014, Korenita river flooding caused a closed mine's tailings dam to overflow, spilling toxic waste onto agricultural land.

Rio Tinto said it planned to convert the liquid waste into ""dry cakes"" to make it easier and safer to store and is planning for once-in-a-millennium floods in its construction.

Argentine austerity protests mount over Macri's IMF-backed measures,"BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Labor unions and social groups blocked streets in downtown Buenos Aires on Wednesday to protest austerity measures proposed by the government and backed by the International Monetary Fund to reduce Argentina’s debt.

Protesters are angry about the belt-tightening policies, which are cutting services to low-income Argentines already walloped by inflation of 31 percent and climbing.

But Argentine leader Mauricio Macri said he needs to carry out such measures to regain investors’ confidence by reducing the country’s spending.

The outlook for Latin America’s third-biggest economy is grim, according to orthodox and left-leaning economists alike. Planned cuts to public utility subsidies, forcing Argentines to pay more for transportation and electricity, are expected to keep upward pressure on consumer prices for the rest of 2018.

“The day-to-day uncertainty is getting worse,” said protester Gabriela Gil, a 49-year-old mother of five.

The year will close with inflation at more than 40 percent, according to economists’ forecasts. Hardest hit are low-income families that spend a high proportion of their income on food.

“The poorest people in the country are on the verge of hunger,” said Daniel Menendez, a spokesman for Barrios de Pie, one of the groups that helped organized the march.

FISCAL MEDICINE

Measures aimed at taming inflation, like the central bank’s 60 percent monetary policy rate, have helped push the economy into recession by choking off credit. Stimulus spending that might pep up the economy would dash Macri’s promise of bringing the primary fiscal deficit to zero next year. The previous 2019 deficit target was 1.3 percent of gross domestic product.

Economy Minister Nicolas Dujovne said earlier this month that it was weakness on the country’s “fiscal flank” that prompted a run on the peso in August. The currency fell 26 percent last month and has lost more than half its value so far in 2018.

On Tuesday, the peso fell 1.4 percent to close at 38.5 per dollar.

Having signed a $50 billion standby financing deal with the IMF in June, the slide in the peso prompted Macri’s administration to pledge deeper spending cuts to secure an early release of funds.

The revamped fiscal targets were being hammered out by government authorities and IMF staff in Buenos Aires, the Fund said in a statement on Wednesday. “Our common objective is to reach a rapid conclusion to these discussions so as to present a proposal to the IMF executive board,” the statement said.

The targets will be incorporated into the 2019 budget bill that Macri is expected to send to Congress over the days ahead.

“What we are seeing in asset prices in Argentina is that people are not giving them the benefit of the doubt,” Daniel Osorio, president of New York-based consultancy Andean Capital Advisors, said in a telephone interview.

With investors demanding that the government stand by its budget-cutting program, some economists say the bitter fiscal medicine called for by the IMF might prove worse than the recession and high inflation that are already ailing Argentina.

“The financial markets have closed for the country. Argentina’s government is responding by attempting a much more drastic fiscal adjustment,” said Martin Guzman, an economist at Columbia University Business School.

“My view is that such a measure will lead to another recession in 2019.”",2018-09-12 16:05:02,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-argentina-economy-idUSKCN1LS305,30
"One month after Cuba protests, hundreds remain behind bars","Gabriela Sequeira Hernandez, 17, detained by police during a protest and waiting for her appeal after being convicted and sentenced to 8 months home arrest, holds her mother's hand during an interview in Havana, Cuba, August 10, 2021.

HAVANA, Aug 12 (Reuters) - Hundreds of people, including dozens of dissident artists and opposition activists, remain detained in Communist-run Cuba a month after unprecedented anti-government protests, according to rights groups.

Thousands took to the streets nationwide on July 11 to protest a dire economic crisis and curbs on civil rights. The government said the unrest was fomented by counter-revolutionaries exploiting hardship caused largely by U.S. sanctions.

Rights group Cubalex has recorded around 800 detentions, a number that has risen daily as relatives come forward. Many are still too afraid to report the arrest of family members, said Cubalex director Laritza Diversent.

Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register

While 249 people have been released, many to house arrest, most remain in ""preventative jail,"" she said. The whereabouts of 10 people is unknown.

Dozens have already been sentenced to up to a year in prison or correctional work in summary trials, with simplified procedures and often without the chance of hiring a defense lawyer on time, said Diversent.

""The government's aim is to make an example of those who protested, to stop others from doing the same,"" she said.

The government did not respond to requests for comment for this story.

Cuban authorities have not given a figure for the total number of detained in the recent unrest but say they have so far carried out trials for 62 people, 22 of which had hired a lawyer. All but one have been deemed guilty of crimes including public disorder, resisting arrest, and vandalism, they said.

The protests were largely peaceful, although state media showed some demonstrators looting and throwing stones at police. One person died and several people, including government supporters, were injured, authorities have confirmed.

Several of those sentenced were not protesting, but were caught up in the unrest, according to their relatives.

Yaquelin Salas, 35, says her husband intervened peacefully in the arrest of a woman, calling on police agents to not treat her so aggressively. Now he is serving a 10-month prison sentence on charges of public disorder after a collective trial in which just two of the 12 detained had lawyers.

""What they are doing is totally unfair,"" said Salas.

Since Cuba's 1959 revolution, authorities have tightly controlled public spaces, saying unity is key to resisting coup attempts by the United States, which has long openly sought to force political change through sanctions and democracy initiatives. The White House has said it will do what it can to support Cuban protesters.

FAMILIES 'SILENCED'

Gabriela Zequeira, 17, one of several minors detained in the protests, said she was sentenced to house arrest for eight months after being arrested while walking home from the hairdressers on July 11.

Upon her admission to jail, where she was kept 10 days incommunicado, she said she was required to put a finger in her vagina to show she was concealing nothing as part of a strip search. Officers kept interrupting her attempts to sleep and one officer made sexual taunts, she said in an interview.

The Cuban government initially said no minors had been detained, a statement later contradicted by state prosecutors.

Some relatives of those detained said authorities were pressuring them to stop speaking out.

""My family has been silenced,"" said emigre Milagros Beirut from her home in Spain. She said four of her relatives in Havana and the eastern city of Guantanamo remained behind bars for protesting peacefully. ""They've been told those detained will receive a stricter sentence if they say anything.""

Dozens of political activists and dissident artists were among the detained, including some who did not participate in the protests but appeared to have been arrested pre-emptively, said Diversent from Cubalex.

Jose Daniel Ferrer, the leader of Cuba's largest opposition group, and Luis Manuel Otero Alcantara, head of a dissident artists collective, were both arrested on their way to the protests before even arriving, according to their supporters.

Ferrer's sister Ana Belkis Ferrer said the family had not been able to speak to or see him, a complaint of many relatives of those detained.

""We don't know if he's being beaten, if he's well or not, whether or not he's doing a hunger strike,"" she said.

Another detained activist, Félix Navarro, 68, president of the Party for Democracy, was in hospital with COVID-19, said Diversent. Several of those detained have denounced unsanitary conditions in jail amid one of the worst COVID-19 outbreaks in the world.

Canada police warn of guns at Ottawa anti-vaccine mandate trucker protest,"A trucker speaks with an Ottawa police officer as protests against the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccine mandates continue in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, February 2, 2022. REUTERS/Blair Gable

OTTAWA, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Police in Ottawa see signs that guns have been brought into a truckers' protest against vaccine mandates that has paralyzed the Canadian capital, the police chief said on Wednesday, adding that calling in the military would pose major risks.

""We have had an indication around firearms coming into this jurisdiction as part of this demonstration as much as a week and a half ago,"" Chief Peter Sloly told a briefing.

He said there was evidence of ""a significant element from the United States in the funding and organizing"" of the protest.

Dozens of truck drivers protesting about COVID-19 vaccine mandates have blocked central routes in the city for six days. Residents have been getting angrier at perceived inaction by the police, who have largely stood to one side.

The protesters say they have no intention of leaving until the government scraps the vaccine mandates.

Police have declined to end the protest, citing the risk of aggravating tensions. They say they are investigating reports of criminal offences, including hate crimes and desecration of public property, and have made three arrests so far.

""We're looking at every single option, including military aid,"" Sloly said. ""Mixing them into a population in the downtown core in a highly volatile demonstration ... may mitigate some risks and may create and escalate a whole bunch of other risks.""

The demonstration began as a move to force the Liberal government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to drop a vaccine mandate for cross-border truckers. It has since turned into a more populist anti-Trudeau movement.

Trudeau on Monday said Canadians were disgusted by the behavior of some protesters and vowed not to be intimidated.

The inaction of police - some of whom have posed for selfies with demonstrators - contrasts with more robust action by authorities in the western province of Alberta.

The Royal Canadian Mounted Police on Tuesday moved in on truckers blockading the U.S. border at the town of Coutts but pulled back after clashes with some drivers.

"Despite Putin's concessions, Russians protest pension reform law","MOSCOW (Reuters) - Thousands of people across Russia joined protests on Sunday against government plans to raise the pension age, despite recent promises by President Vladimir Putin to soften the unpopular measure.

Sunday’s protests show that the proposed policy remains a politically sensitive issue for the government despite concessions offered by Putin in a televised address on Wednesday.

During the speech, Putin took personal responsibility for the reform for the first time and described it as a financial necessity. He ended his address by asking the Russian people for their understanding.

Around 9,000 people gathered just a couple of kilometers (1.5 miles) from the Kremlin, according to White Counter, an NGO that counts participants at rallies, but Moscow police put the numbers at 6,000.

Many carried the red flags and banners of the principal organizer of the protest, the KPRF Communist Party.

A large banner reading “We do not trust United Russia”, Putin’s ruling party, was held up by the crowd and featured a drawing of a red fist punching the white polar bear logo of Putin’s party.

“Today we are holding an all-Russia protest against this cannibalistic reform,” veteran Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov said, addressing the crowd.

He went on to list his party’s proposals for raising money for the state budget, focused on taxing Russia’s so-called oligarchs, instead of raising the retirement age.

Speakers also voiced their support for the party’s candidate in the Moscow mayoral election, which will be held on Sept. 9.

A separate gathering in the city, organized by the Just Russia party, attracted a further 1,500 people protesting against the pension reforms, Moscow police said.

In his address on Wednesday, Putin watered down the original draft pension reform legislation, introduced by the government on June 14, which opinion polls showed was opposed by 90 percent of Russians and which has provoked a string of protests in recent weeks.

Polls by the Levada Centre show Putin’s personal approval rating has fallen around 10 percentage points since the pension reforms were proposed, although it still stands at around 70 percent.

Putin, who was re-elected in March, offered to cut the proposed retirement age for women to 60, from a retirement age of 63 first proposed by the government. Russian women currently retire at 55.

Putin said that the proposal to raise the pension age for men from 60 to 65 would remain unchanged.

Raising the retirement age would allow the government to pay out bigger pensions, Putin said, describing their current size as modest. The government says the average monthly pension will be 14,414 roubles ($212) by the end of the year, compared with 13,339 in July, as calculated by the Federal Statistics Service.

Last year, a government provision set the average cost of living for pensioners at 8,496 roubles.

NOT JUST IN MOSCOW

Protests also took place across Russia

In St Petersburg, the Fontanka newspaper said that around 1,500 people gathered to protest, while the Interfax News Agency said 1,200 joined a protest in Novosibirsk and 250 in Vladivostok.

In Yekaterinburg in the Ural mountains, around 450 people took part in a demonstration entitled the “Regiment of Shame”, during which protesters held portraits of politicians who have voiced their support for pension reform, local newspaper Nasha Gazeta said.

In Russia’s south, there were protests in the Black Sea port of Novorossiisk, Astrakhan, Rostov-on-Don and in the capitals of the Caucasus republics of Karachay-Cherkessia and Kabardino-Balkaria, according to Interfax.

People also took to the streets in the town of Simferopol in Crimea, the Black Sea peninsula annexed by Russia from Ukraine in 2014, Interfax added.

Another series of protests, this time organized by Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, is due to take place on Sept. 9. Navalny was jailed for 30 days on Monday for breaking protest laws, a move he said was aimed at stopping him from leading the scheduled rally against pension reform.",2018-09-02 07:18:21,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-protests-pensions-idUSKCN1LI0DU,33
"At least 15 people shot dead in anti-coup protests in Sudan, medics say","Protesters carry a banner and national flags as they march against the Sudanese military's recent seizure of power and ousting of the civilian government, in the streets of the capital Khartoum, Sudan October 30, 2021. REUTERS/Mohamed Nureldin/File Photo

KHARTOUM, Nov 17 (Reuters) - Security forces shot dead at least 15 people and wounded dozens as thousands of Sudanese took to the streets on Wednesday on the deadliest day in a month of demonstrations against military rule, medics said.

The protesters, marching against an Oct. 25 coup across the capital Khartoum and in the cities of Bahri and Omdurman, demanded a full handover to civilian authorities and for the leaders of the Oct. 25 coup to be put on trial.

Security forces fired live rounds and tear gas to prevent gatherings in all three cities, and mobile phone communications were cut, witnesses said. State television said there were injuries among protesters and police.

""The coup forces used live bullets heavily in different areas of the capital and there are tens of gunshot injuries, some of them in serious condition,"" said the Central Committee of Sudanese Doctors, a group aligned with the protest movement. Deaths were concentrated in Bahri, they said.

In response, protesters built extensive barricades, emptying the streets of traffic, a Reuters witness said.

""People are just terrified right now,"" said an Omdurman protester.

Earlier, on a main road in Khartoum, protesters burned tyres and chanted: ""The people are stronger, and retreat is impossible.""

Others carried pictures of people killed in previous protests and of Abdalla Hamdok, the civilian prime minister who was put under house arrest during the coup, with the slogan: ""Legitimacy comes from the street, not from the cannons.""

Images of protests in towns including Port Sudan, Kassala, Dongola, Wad Madani and Geneina were posted on social media.

Security forces were heavily deployed on main roads and intersections, and bridges across the River Nile were closed, witnesses said.

There was no immediate comment from the security forces and a police representative could not be reached for comment. Military leader General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan has said peaceful protests are allowed and the military does not kill protesters.

U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs Molly Phee said in a tweet: ""I am saddened by reports of violence and loss of life today in Sudan. We condemn violence towards peaceful protesters and call for the respect and protection of human rights in Sudan.""

Phee met Hamdok during a visit to Khartoum on Tuesday where they discussed ways to restore Sudan's democratic transition.

ARRESTS

Despite pressure from Western states, which have suspended economic assistance, efforts at mediation have stalled, with Burhan moving to cement control with help from Bashir-era veterans. read more

Speaking in Kenya, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said ""We back (the Sudanese people's) call to restore Sudan’s democratic transition,"" adding that the country had been on a path towards stability and that he was ""engaged intensely"" in the matter.

Protesters and a Reuters witness said they saw security forces chase protesters into neighbourhoods and homes to carry out arrests.

""We haven't ever had violence in Bahri like today's, even under the old regime,"" said one demonstrator, who said the air was thick with tear gas and security forces used live bullets into Wednesday night.

""The coup forces are practising excessive repression and are encircling the revolutionaries' marches in several areas,"" said the Sudanese Professionals Association, which has helped promote the protests.

""This was preceded by the deliberate interruption of voice and internet communications services.""

Mobile internet services in Sudan have been suspended since Oct. 25, complicating a campaign of anti-military rallies, strikes and civil disobedience.

The doctors' committee and other unions said in a statement that security forces had tried to raid one hospital in Omdurman and were surrounding another, releasing tear gas and blocking patients' access. The same was witnessed at hospitals in Bahri, said a demonstrator.

Wednesday's deaths brought the committee's death toll since the coup to 39 people.

""Military commanders will be held accountable for these abuses,"" said the U.N. special rapporteur on Freedom of Association and Peaceful, Assembly Clement Voule, in a tweet.

"Kazakhstan declares state of emergency in protest-hit city, province","ALMATY, Jan 5 (Reuters) - Kazakh President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev has declared a two-week state of emergency in the Central Asian nation's biggest city Almaty and in the western Mangistau province where protests turned violent, his office said early on Wednesday.

The move includes an 11 p.m. to 7 a.m. curfew, movement restrictions, and a ban on mass gatherings, according to documents published on the president's website.

""Calls to attack government and military offices are absolutely illegal,"" Tokayev said in a video address a few hours earlier. ""The government will not fall, but we want mutual trust and dialogue rather than conflict.""

As he spoke, police in Almaty used tear gas and stun grenades to stop hundreds of protesters from storming the mayor's office, a Reuters correspondent reported from the scene.

The oil-rich country's government announced late on Tuesday it was restoring some price caps on liquefied petroleum gas, after the rare protests reached Almaty following a sharp rise in the price of the fuel at the start of the year.

Many Kazakhs have converted their cars to run on LPG, which is far cheaper than gasoline as a vehicle fuel in Kazakhstan because of price caps. But the government argued that the low price was unsustainable and lifted the caps on Jan. 1.

PRICE SPIKE

After the price of the fuel spiked, rallies involving thousands of people erupted on Jan. 2 in the town of Zhanaozen, an oil hub and site of deadly clashes between protesters and police a decade ago.

Demonstrations spread to other parts of surrounding Mangistau province and western Kazakhstan, including provincial centre Aktau and a worker camp used by sub-contractors of Kazakhstan's biggest oil producer, Tengizchevroil. The Chevron-led (CVX.N) venture said output had not been affected.

In Almaty, police appeared to have taken control of the main square shortly after deploying flashbang grenades, according to online video streams from the area. But explosions were heard for hours on nearby streets and in other parts of the city.

Videos published online showed torched police cars in the city, as well as armoured vehicles moving through one of its main thoroughfares.

On Tuesday evening, the government announced it was restoring the price cap of 50 tenge (11 cents) per litre, or less than half the market price, in Mangistau province.

Public protests are illegal in the country of 19 million unless their organisers file a notice in advance.

Tokayev, the hand-picked successor of Soviet-era Communist boss Nursultan Nazarbayev who stepped down in 2019, faces no political opposition in parliament.

The president said on Twitter on Tuesday that he would hold a government meeting the following day to discuss the protesters' demands. He urged protesters to behave responsibly.

Thousands stage peaceful protest in Ottawa against Canada's vaccine mandates,"Trucks sit parked on Wellington Street near the Parliament Buildings as truckers and their supporters take part in a convoy to protest coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccine mandates for cross-border truck drivers in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, January 29, 2022. REUTERS/Patrick Doyle

OTTAWA, Jan 29 (Reuters) - Thousands held a loud but peaceful protest in Canada's capital Ottawa on Saturday against Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's COVID-19 vaccine mandates, on the streets and snow-covered lawn in front of parliament.

The so-called ""Freedom Convoy"" started out as a rally of truckers against a vaccine requirement for cross-borderdrivers, but turned into a demonstration against government overreach during the pandemic with a strong anti-vaccination streak.

""I'm not able to work no more because I can't cross the border,"" said Csava Vizi, a trucker from Windsor who noted he was the family's sole breadwinner.

Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register

""I refuse the vaccine,"" he said, calling it dangerous. He spoke from inside his truck in front of parliament.

""It's not just about the vaccines. It's about stopping the public health mandates altogether,"" said Daniel Bazinet, owner of Valley Flatbed & Transportation in Nova Scotia on the Atlantic coast. Bazinet is unvaccinated, but operates domestically and so is not affected by the cross-border mandate.

""Myself and a lot of other people are here because we're just sick of the vaccine mandates and the lockdowns,"" said Brendon from Ottawa, who declined to give his last name. He was carrying a sign reading: ""Justin Trudeau makes me ashamed to be a Canadian"".

The rally started early and built through the afternoon. Some handed out bag lunches to the truckers, who convoyed to Ottawa from the east and west coasts and places in between.

Few wore masks, but many were in balaclavas as the temperature with windchill was minus 21 Celsius (minus 6 Fahrenheit). A downtown mall closed because demonstrators refused to wear masks inside, CTV reported.

The violent rhetoric used by some of the promoters on social media in the run-up to the protest had worried police, who were out in force, but mostly the protest felt like a very cold street party, punctuated by blaring truck horns.

Due to security concerns, Trudeau and his family left their downtown Ottawa home due to security concerns, the CBC reported. His office said it does not comment on security matters.

Earlier this week Trudeau said the convoy represented a ""small fringe minority"" who do not represent the views of Canadians. About 90% of Canada's cross-border truckers and 77% of the population have had two COVID vaccination shots.

Trudeau announced a vaccine mandate for federal workers on the eve of the October election, then last month Canada and the United States imposed one for cross-border truckers.

Conservative leader Erin O'Toole opposes vaccine mandates and expressed support for the protest after holding talks with some of the truckers on Friday.

""I support their right to be heard, and I call on Justin Trudeau to meet with these hard-working Canadians to hear their concerns,"" O'Toole said after the meeting.

The Canadian Trucking Alliance, which represents some 4,500 carriers, owner-operators and industry suppliers, has opposed the demonstration.

""We ask the Canadian public to be aware that many of the people you see and hear in media reports do not have a connection to the trucking industry,"" the CTA said on Saturday.

The CTA urged the truckers who participated to do so peacefully and then leave Ottawa. The protest organizers had said they would stay in Ottawa until the government abandons the mandates. Downtown streets could be clogged for days.

""If I have to stay here two months, I'm going be here,"" said Vizi.

Taliban urge Afghan unity as protests spread to Kabul,"Summary Protests in Kabul and eastern cities, several killed

Anti-Taliban opposition leader supports protests

U.S. says 6,000 more people set to board planes in Kabul

KABUL, Aug 19 (Reuters) - The Taliban called on Afghanistan's imams to urge unity when they hold their first Friday prayers since the Islamist group seized control of the country, as protests against the takeover spread to more cities on Thursday, including the capital, Kabul.

Several people were killed when Taliban militants fired on a crowd in the eastern city of Asadabad, a witness said. Another witness reported gunshots near a rally in Kabul, but they appeared to be Taliban firing into the air.

On the day Afghanistan celebrates its independence from British control in 1919, a social media video showed a crowd of men and women in Kabul waving black, red and green national flags.

""Our flag, our identity,"" they shouted.

At some protests elsewhere, media reported people tearing down the Taliban's white flag.

A Taliban spokesman was not immediately available for comment.

Some demonstrations were small, but combined with the desperate scramble of thousands of people seeking to flee the country they underline the challenge the Taliban face in governing.

Kabul has been largely calm, but 12 people have been killed in and around the airport, NATO and Taliban officials said.

The U.S. military said more than 5,200 American troops were guarding Kabul airport, where multiple gates to the facility are now open, while U.S. fighter jets were flying over the city to ensure security for the evacuation operation for diplomats and civilians including some Afghan citizens.

State Department spokesman Ned Price said 6,000 ""fully processed"" people were currently at the Kabul airport and would soon be boarding planes. A source told Reuters that White House officials told a congressional briefing that the United States already had evacuated 6,741 people, including 1,792 American citizens and legal permanent residents.

The Taliban swiftly conquered Afghanistan as U.S. and other foreign troops withdrew, surprising even their own leaders and leaving power vacuums in many places.

The Taliban urged unity ahead of Friday prayers, calling on imams to persuade people not to leave Afghanistan.

Since seizing Kabul on Sunday, the Taliban have presented a more moderate face, saying they want peace, will not take revenge against old enemies and will respect the rights of women within the framework of Islamic law.

When in power from 1996-2001, they severely restricted women's rights, staged public executions and blew up ancient Buddhist statues. They were ousted in a 2001 U.S.-led invasion.

BLACKLIST

A report by a Norwegian intelligence group said the Taliban had begun rounding up Afghans on a blacklist of people linked to Afghanistan's previous administration or U.S.-led forces that supported it. Complaints by some Afghan journalists have cast doubt on assurances that independent media would be allowed.

A U.S. lawmaker said the Taliban were using files from Afghanistan's intelligence agency, the National Directorate of Security, to identify Afghans who worked for the United States.

""They are methodically ramping up efforts to round those folks up,"" said Representative Jason Crow, who has been leading efforts in the U.S. Congress to accelerate the evacuation of American-affiliated Afghans. ""I've had people send me pictures of Taliban outside their apartment complexes, searching for them.""

Crow voiced concern that the U.S. government may end the evacuation operation on Aug. 31, leaving more than 100,000 at-risk Afghans and family members in danger of Taliban reprisals.

Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn said they had moved to secure the accounts of Afghan citizens to protect them from being targeted amid the Taliban's takeover.

loading

It was unclear if the Asadabad casualties resulted from Taliban firing or from a stampede.

""Hundreds of people came out on the streets,"" witness Mohammed Salim said. ""At first I was scared and didn't want to go, but when I saw one of my neighbours joined in, I took out the flag I have at home. Several people were killed and injured in the stampede and firing by the Taliban.""

Protests flared in the city of Jalalabad and in Paktia province, also in the east.

First Vice President Amrullah Saleh, who said on Tuesday he was the ""legitimate caretaker president"" after President Ashraf Ghani fled, wrote on Twitter: ""Salute those who carry the national flag and thus stand for dignity of the nation.""

Ahmad Massoud, son of guerrilla leader Ahmad Shah Massoud, who was killed by suspected al Qaeda militants in 2001, wrote in a Washington Post op-ed that he is ""ready to follow in my father's footsteps, with mujahideen fighters who are prepared to once again take on the Taliban.""

LIMITED LEVERAGE

U.S. President Joe Biden said the Taliban must decide if they want international recognition.

""Do they want to be recognized by the international community as being a legitimate government? I'm not sure they do,"" Biden said in TV interview.

White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said in an interview with NBC News that the United States is ""laser-focused"" on ""the potential for a terrorist attack"" by a group like Islamic State amid the evacuation.

""We will get any American who wants to get to the airport and who we get in contact with who says: 'I want to get out and get on a plane,' we will make that happen,"" Sullivan said.

About two dozen U.S. diplomats in Afghanistan sent an internal cable last month warning Secretary of State Antony Blinken of the potential fall of Kabul to the Taliban as U.S. troops withdrew from the country, The Wall Street Journal reported.

G7 foreign ministers called for a united international response to prevent the crisis from worsening, in comments echoed by countries including Russia. China said the world should support, not pressure, Afghanistan.

A Taliban official said they could not be blamed for the chaos at Kabul airport. In one scene captured on social media, a small girl was hoisted over the airport's perimeter wall and handed to a U.S. soldier.

Under a pact negotiated by former President Donald Trump's administration, the United States agreed to withdraw its forces in exchange for a Taliban guarantee not to attack departing foreign forces or let Afghanistan be used for terrorist attacks.

Protests in France against COVID-19 'health pass' rules,"A demonstrator argues with police officers during a protest against the new measures announced by French President Emmanuel Macron to fight the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak, in Paris, France, July 14, 2021. REUTERS/Gonzalo Fuentes

PARIS, July 14 (Reuters) - Police in Paris clashed with protesters railing against President Emmanuel Macron's plan to require a COVID-19 vaccine certificate or negative PCR test to gain entry to bars, restaurants and cinemas from next month.

Macron this week announced sweeping measures to fight a rapid surge in new coronavirus infections, including the mandatory vaccination of health workers and new health pass rules for the wider public.

In doing so, he went further than most other European nations have done as the highly contagious Delta variant fans a new wave of cases, and other governments are watching carefully to see how the French public responds.

The police fired tear gas on several occasions as pockets of protesters overturned garbage cans and set a mechanical digger alight. Some protesters away from the skirmishes wore badges saying ""No to the health pass"".

Some critics of Macron's plan - which will require shopping malls, cafes, bars and restaurants to check the health passes of all patrons from August - accuse the president of trampling on freedoms and discriminating against those who do not want the COVID shot.

""It's totally arbitrary and wholly undemocratic,"" said one protester who identified himself as Jean-Louis.

Macron says the vaccine is the best way to put France back on the path to normalcy and that he is encouraging as many people as possible to get inoculated.

There were protests in other cities including Nantes, Marseille and Montpellier.

The show of discontent took place on Bastille Day, the anniversary of the 1789 storming of a medieval fortress in Paris which marked the turning point in the French Revolution.

Among other proposals in the government's draft bill is the mandatory isolation for 10 days of anyone who tests positive, with police making random checks, French media reported. The prime minister's office did not respond when asked to confirm the detail.

The Khartoum security committee's statement added that 114 people had been arrested and faced prosecution after Saturday's protests, the latest in a series of rallies against an Oct. 25 coup that upended a transition towards democratic elections.

Medics aligned with the protest movement said earlier that violence by security forces had caused 178 injuries among demonstrators, including eight with live bullet wounds.

Death toll from Colombia protests rises as cities brace for COVID fallout,"Demonstrators take part in a protest demanding government action to tackle poverty, police violence and inequalities in healthcare and education systems, in Bogota, Colombia, May 9, 2021. REUTERS/Luisa Gonzalez

BOGOTA, May 11 (Reuters) - The reported death toll from nearly two weeks of anti-government protests in Colombia rose past 40 on Tuesday, a day ahead of a planned national strike, while major cities warned of a prolonged peak in COVID-19 cases due to demonstrations.

Violent protests fueled by outrage at a now-canceled tax plan began on April 28. Demonstrator demands have expanded to include a basic income, an end to police violence and the withdrawal of a long-debated health reform.

Smaller protests and road blockades have continued daily around the country. Unions and student groups have called for a national strike on Wednesday after a meeting with President Ivan Duque left them at odds with the government. read more

Colombia's human rights ombudsman said it had received reports of the deaths of 41 civilians and one police officer. It is verifying if they are directly connected to the protests.

The police and its ESMAD riot squad are presumed responsible for 11 killings, the ombudsman has previously said, while it classed seven deaths as unrelated to the marches themselves.

""We call for all necessary measures to be taken to put an end to the violence that is bleeding Colombia dry,"" the ombudsman's office said on Twitter.

Local advocacy group Temblores says 40 protesters have allegedly been killed by police, while Human Rights Watch said it has received 46 credible reports of protest deaths and verified 13.

So far three police officers are facing murder charges connected to demonstrator deaths.

Duque visited the city of Cali - a focal point for protests - for a second day in a row on Tuesday and announced poor and working class students at public universities and technical schools will pay no tuition next semester.

The center-right president lacks strong backing in Congress, where his tax proposal, which would have expanded items subject to sales tax, was heavily criticized. His term ends in August next year.

The three largest cities in Colombia, which has recorded nearly 79,000 COVID-19 deaths, are now bracing for an extended third peak in coronavirus cases and over-stretched intensive care units, local authorities said.

Capital Bogota is confronting a ""hospital collapse,"" Mayor Claudia Lopez said in a press conference on Monday, and will not see infections drop this week as previously predicted.

A fall in infections will not come until the end of May, Lopez said, adding that protests make quarantine restrictions nearly unenforceable, although she extended a curfew and restriction on alcohol sales.

Medellin, whose ICUs have been at or near full-capacity for weeks, is preparing for a possible crisis, health secretary Andree Uribe told Reuters in a video.

""We know there will be an increase in cases, we're on alert, we are carrying out actions for early identification, like testing everyone who participated in the marches,"" she said.

In Cali, demonstrations are likely to extend a current peak, health secretary Miyerlandi Torres said.

""We're worried about marchers who don't comply with any of the self-protection protocols like physical distancing and the use of face masks,"" she said. ""And with the presence of strains like the British one, which are highly contagious, it's indicated the figures won't fall in the short term.""

Cali's ICUs are about 95% occupied, according to local government figures.

Apple puts supplier Foxconn's India plant on notice after protests,"CHENNAI, Dec 29 (Reuters) - Apple (AAPL.O) said it had placed the southern Indian factory of iPhone assembler Foxconn (2317.TW) on probation after both companies found that some worker dormitories and dining rooms did not meet required standards.

Apple did not explain what probation meant.

When it placed the southern India plant of another supplier, Wistron Corp (3231.TW), on probation after unrest last year, it said it would not award that company new business until it addressed the way workers were treated.

The latest action follows protests that erupted this month after more than 250 women who work at the Foxconn plant and live in one of the dormitories were treated for food poisoning. More than 150 were hospitalised, Reuters reported.

The plant, which is located in the town of Sriperumbudur town near Chennai and employs about 17,000 people, was closed on Dec 18. Apple and Foxconn did not say when they expected it to reopen.

A spokesperson for Taiwan's Foxconn said on Wednesday that it was restructuring its local management team, taking immediate steps to improve facilities and added that all employees would continue to be paid while it makes necessary improvements to restart operations.

An Apple spokesperson said on Wednesday it had dispatched independent auditors to assess conditions at the dormitories ""following recent concerns about food safety and accommodation conditions at Foxconn Sriperumbudur.""

Apple said it had found that some of the dormitory accommodations and dining rooms, which were not on the factory's premises, did not meet its requirements and that it was working with the supplier to ensure a comprehensive set of corrective actions, adding that it will ensure its strict standards are met before the facility reopens.

A senior government official familiar with the matter said Foxconn has been answering queries from the state government on amenities provided to workers. ""Once they get clearances from the government, workers will be inducted and the company will resume production,"" the official said.

A second official said the reopening of the Foxconn plant in Chennai could be delayed until Monday.

Earlier this week, Reuters reported that Foxconn as well as 11 of its contractors including those who provide food and living facilities, were summoned for a meeting with the state government and that officials had asked Foxconn to review services provided to the workers, including power backup at the hostels, food and water.

The impact on Apple from the closure of the plant, which makes iPhone 12 models and has started trial production of the iPhone 13, is expected to be minimal, analysts have said. But the factory is strategic in the long term as the U.S. tech giant tries to cut its reliance on its Chinese supply chain amid trade tensions between Washington and Beijing.

Sunday protests have largely died down

Dozens still detained - rights group

HAVANA, July 13 (Reuters) - Cuba has restricted access to social media and messaging platforms including Facebook and WhatsApp, global internet monitoring firm NetBlocks said on Tuesday, in the wake of the biggest anti-government protests in decades.

Thousands of Cubans joined demonstrations throughout the Communist-run country on Sunday to protest against a deep economic crisis that has seen shortages of basic goods and power outages. They were also protesting against the government's handling of the coronavirus pandemic and curbs on civil liberties.

Cuba's government has said the demonstrations were orchestrated by counter-revolutionaries financed by the United States, manipulating frustration with an economic crisis largely caused by the decades-old U.S. trade embargo.

The protests, rare in a country where public dissent is tightly controlled, had largely ended by Sunday evening, as security forces were deployed to the streets and President Miguel Diaz-Canel called on government supporters to go out and fight to defend their revolution.

But another protest flared late Monday in the southern Havana suburb of La Guinera, where one man died and several others, including members of the security forces, were hospitalized with injuries, according to state-run media on Tuesday.

It did not say what caused the death. No other deaths and injuries have been officially confirmed so far.

Hundreds had taken to streets in La Guinera, shouting slogans like 'down with communism,' and 'freedom for the people of Cuba,' according to two residents and video footage seen by Reuters. Some started throwing rocks at security forces who eventually responded with gunfire, said resident Waldo Herrera, 49.

""I think the Communists have lost control, they won't have a solution to this situation,"" he said. ""The people are tired of so much humiliation, so much repression.""

A Reuters witness saw dozens of people carrying sticks departing La Guinera late on Monday.

Activists say the government is using so-called rapid-reaction brigades - government-organized bands of civilian recruits - to counter protesters.

MOBILE INTERNET OUTAGES

They also accuse the government of trying to disrupt communications. Introduced just over two years ago, mobile internet has been a key factor behind the protests, giving Cubans more of a platform to express their frustrations and enabling the word to get out quickly when people are on the street.

In the capital, there have been regular and atypical mobile internet outages since Sunday, according to Reuters witnesses.

NetBlocks, based in London, said on its website that Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram and Telegram in Cuba were partially disrupted on Monday and Tuesday.

""The pattern of restrictions observed in Cuba indicate an ongoing crackdown on messaging platforms used to organize and share news of protests in real-time,"" said NetBlocks director Alp Toker. ""At the same time, some connectivity is preserved to maintain a semblance of normality.""

Facebook Inc (FB.O), which owns Instagram and WhatsApp, said that it was concerned about its services being restricted in Cuba, in a statement to Reuters late on Tuesday.

""We oppose shutdowns, throttling, and other disruptions of the internet that limit the debate of our community. We hope connectivity will be restored as soon as possible so that Cubans can communicate with family and friends,"" said Joe Osborne, a Facebook spokesperson.

Asked whether the government was intentionally restricting internet connections, Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez told a news briefing the situation was ""complicated."" He said power outages could impact telecommunications services and ""Cuba would never renounce the right to defend itself.""

Telegram did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) said it found no blocking of its service.

""Our weapon is the internet. If they take away the internet we are unarmed,"" said Havana resident Gino Ocumares, as he tried but failed to connect to the web at a government Wi-Fi hotspot. ""The government does not want people to see the truth.""

'PROVOCATIONS'

The protest in La Guinera was spearheaded by ""antisocial and criminal elements"" that had tried to reach the police station with the aim of attacking its officials and damaging infrastructure, said the state-run Cuban News Agency.

When security forces stopped them, they vandalized homes, set containers on fire, and damaged the suburb's electricity wiring, attacking officials with stones and other objects, the agency said.

State-run media also reported on Tuesday that Raul Castro, who stepped down as head of the ruling Cuban Communist Party in April, attended a meeting on Sunday of the political bureau to address the ""provocations.""

Diaz-Canel said in April he would continue to consult Castro on matters of utmost importance.

The Cuban Bishops Conference said in a statement it was worried that the response to protests over legitimate concerns would be ""immobilism"" rather than an attempt to resolve them, and even a counterproductive hardening of positions.

Reaction to the protest in Latin America split along ideological lines, with Mexico's president blaming the U.S. embargo for fomenting the unrest, while Chile and Peru urged the government to allow pro-democracy protests.

U.S. President Joe Biden said on Monday that the United States ""stands firmly with the people of Cuba as they assert their universal rights.""

State Department spokesman Ned Price called on the Havana government to open all means of communication, both online and offline.

""Shutting down technology, shutting down information pathways - that does nothing to address the legitimate needs and aspirations of the Cuban people,"" Price told a news briefing on Tuesday.

Protests across Tunisia target Ennahda party over political crisis,"TUNIS, July 25 (Reuters) - Police and protesters clashed in several Tunisian cities on Sunday as demonstrators demanding the government step down attacked offices of Ennahda, the moderate Islamist party that is the biggest in parliament.

Witnesses said protesters stormed or tried to storm Ennahda offices in Monastir, Sfax, El Kef and Sousse, while in Touzeur they set fire to the party's local headquarters.

The violence came as hundreds of protesters rallied in each of the main cities after a spike in COVID-19 cases that has aggravated economic troubles and exposed the failings of a squabbling political class.

The protests, the biggest in Tunisia for months and the biggest to target Ennahda for years, were called by social media activists. No political parties publicly backed the rallies.

In Tunis, police used pepper spray against protesters who threw stones and shouted slogans demanding that Prime Minister Hichem Mechichi quit and parliament be dissolved. There were other big protests in Gafsa, Sidi Bouzid and Nabeul.

The protests raise pressure on a fragile government that is enmeshed in a political struggle with President Kais Saied, as the government tries to avert a looming fiscal crisis amid a weeks-long spike in COVID-19 cases and increased death rates.

The pandemic has hammered the economy which was already struggling in the aftermath of the 2011 revolution that ousted long-time authoritarian leader Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali.

Public support for democracy has waned amid surging unemployment and crumbling state services.

""Our patience has run out... there are no solutions for the unemployed,"" said Nourredine Selmi, 28, a jobless protester. ""They cannot control the epidemic ... They can't give us vaccines.""

Last week, Mechichi sacked the health minister after chaotic scenes at walk-in vaccination centres during the Muslim Eid al-Adha holiday, where large crowds queued for inadequate supplies of vaccine.

After a year of wrangling with Mechichi and the leader of Ennahda, Rached Ghannouchi, who is also parliament speaker, President Saied declared the army would take over the pandemic response.

Some analysts saw the move as an attempt to expand his powers beyond the foreign and military role assigned to the president in the 2014 constitution.

Ennahda, banned before the revolution, has been the most consistently successful political party since then and a member of successive government coalitions. It has backed Mechichi, a political independent, in his disputes with the president.

""The message of anger was well received... but violence and burning are unacceptable,"" said party official Maher Mahioub.

Government paralysis could derail efforts to negotiate an International Monetary Fund loan seen as crucial to stabilising state finances but which could also involve spending cuts that would aggravate economic pain for ordinary people.

Key Kazakh oilfield hit by protests,"LONDON, Jan 6 (Reuters) - Oil production at Kazakhstan's top field Tengiz was reduced on Thursday, its operator Chevron (CVX.N) said, as some contractors disrupted train lines in support of protests taking place across the central Asian country.

Demonstrations in the west of the country against a New Year's Day fuel price hike have quickly grown into deadly anti-government riots with Russia sending in paratroopers to put down the countrywide uprising. read more

Kazakhstan is a major oil producer with output of about 1.6 million barrels per day (bpd) in recent months, and has rarely seen production disrupted by unrest or natural disaster.

""TCO production operations continue, however, there has been a temporary adjustment to output due to logistics,"" Chevron, the largest foreign oil producer in Kazakhstan with a 50% stake in the Tengizchevroil (TCO) joint venture, said in a statement.

Protestors at the field have disrupted train activity which is used to export oil, sources told Reuters.

TCO produces around 700,000 bpd. It was not clear by how much output has been reduced. Other top fields in Kazakhstan are onshore Karachaganak and offshore Kashagan.

Besides Chevron, the three key projects involve most top foreign companies including Exxon Mobil, Lukoil, Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L), Eni, TotalEnergies (TTEF.PA), CNPC and Inpex.

A Shell spokesperson said production at the Karachaganak and Kashagan ventures was continuing.

""We are following developments in Kazakhstan closely. We are focusing on keeping our people and operations safe, working closely with our venture partners... We are keeping the situation under constant review.""

"Ahead of planned protests, Cuban government and dissidents wage 'battle of ideas'","Protesters shout slogans against the government during a demonstration, which also involved counter-protesters who are in support of the government, amidst the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak, in Havana, Cuba July 11, 2021. REUTERS/Alexandre Meneghin/File Photo

HAVANA, Nov 10 (Reuters) - A war of words fought in the media and rife with espionage - double agents, wire taps and hidden cameras - is raging in Cuba ahead of protests planned for Nov. 15, setting up a showdown between the government and a dissident movement that says its most potent weapon is the cellphone.

Dissidents in September requested permission to conduct a ""Civic March for Change"" in mid-November, following widespread protests on the island in July. The Communist-run government denied that request last month, but protesters say they plan to go ahead anyway.

The government has since launched a media campaign employing tactics favored by former Cuban leader Fidel Castro, leveraging the state security forces to unearth evidence it says proves the organizers are working covertly with the United States to overthrow the government, a charge the protest leaders deny.

Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register

Historians and long-time Cuba watchers say Nov. 15 will mark the first real test of the government's Cold War-era strategies against a movement that is younger and more internet savvy than any before it.

""Clearly, they've reverted to their old playbook,"" said Paul Hare, a former British ambassador to Cuba during the so-called ""Black Spring"" in 2003 when Castro jailed 75 dissidents.

But with more Cubans online than ever before, it has become more difficult for the government to dominate the airwaves, Hare said. ""They've lost the narrative, the battle of ideas, especially with young people.""

A Cuban government spokesperson rejected that argument.

""In Cuba, there is another youth, with many other viewpoints, the majority of which are not considered by international media,"" the spokesperson said.

The stakes for Cuba are high, said historian Michael Bustamante of the University of Miami. Protesters plan to march the same day that Cuba reopens its doors to international tourism after a nearly two-year hiatus during the coronavirus pandemic. Tourist revenue is vital to Cuba's ailing economy.

""This is the moment where the Cuban state is looking to turn the corner on what has been a very bad year... and here you have this group saying 'no, we are choosing this specific moment to press for political change',"" said Bustamante.

""I think that explains the intensity of the state's response.""

SPYCRAFT

The call for protests is being led by a Facebook group called Archipielago. It said in a Nov. 3 post on the platform that it has 31,501 members, the majority of which are between 25 and 44 years old.

In a barrage of primetime television news programs on state-run channels, Cuba's government has used spycraft to question the motives of Yunior Garcia, a Cuban playwright who is the leader of Archipielago.

In a dramatic TV segment aired last week, a cancer doctor in hospital scrubs revealed he was really 'Agente Fernando,' a double-agent who for 25 years infiltrated the dissident movement and accompanied Garcia to a workshop to discuss the Cuban military's role in promoting a transition to democracy.

""Yunior Garcia Aguilera is looking for a confrontation between the armed forces and the people,"" Fernando told viewers of the program.

Reuters was unable to reach Fernando, whose real name is Dr. Carlos Leonardo Vazquez, for comment.

Garcia told Reuters he recalls Fernando at the workshop but rejected any suggestion he was seeking to violently overthrow the government.

He said he has never taken U.S. funds.

""It is very difficult for the regime to admit that it has deployed all its forces against a group of young people on phones,"" Garcia said in an interview at his home in Havana. ""They are scared of a public that no longer believes in them and that isn't afraid to say so on social media.""

Garcia says Cuban authorities have thus leaned on an age-old strategy: blaming the United States.

In another segment, state-run TV aired a phone call in which Ramon Saul Sanchez, a Miami-based exile whom Cuba accuses of being behind a series of terror attacks decades ago, appears to pledge support to Garcia and asks whether he should send a flotilla of boats into waters near Cuba on the day of the planned protests. Garcia is reluctant.

Garcia confirmed the call took place and said it was recorded without his knowledge.

Sanchez, who has denied the terror attack accusations, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The Cuban government has said their evidence points to a movement that is looking to topple the leadership and is backed by outsiders.

Such subterfuge is not without precedent. A 1975 U.S. Senate committee report revealed attempts by U.S. spies to kill Castro using ""devices that strain the imagination,"" including exploding cigars and poison pills. As recently as 2009, the United States backed efforts to create a ""Cuban Twitter"" to stir unrest on the island.

Nearly half of Archipielago members reside outside of Cuba, according to figures provided by the group. Around one-quarter live in the United States.

The U.S. State Department did not immediately reply to a request for comment. In late October, a department spokesman said the United States supports the right of Cubans to protest but that the rallies were not a ""demonstration... of the desires of the United States government.""

The U.S. government has threatened sanctions amid a wave of arrests following the July 11 protests, believed to be the largest since Castro's 1959 revolution. Cuban authorities say those arrested were guilty of crimes including public disorder, resisting arrest, and vandalism.

Many who have publicly advocated for protests say they have been harassed or put on notice by state security and government supporters in a bid to keep them off the streets next Monday.

It is not clear how many plan to march on Nov. 15, either at home or abroad, nor what the Cuban government's response will be.

""I think the question is whether Cuba can put the July 11 genie back in the bottle or not,"" said Bustamante. ""November 15 will be one measure of that.""

"Taliban response to Afghan protests increasingly violent, UN says","GENEVA, Sept 10 (Reuters) - The U.N. rights office on Friday said that the Taliban response to peaceful marches in Afghanistan has been increasingly violent, with authorities using live ammunition, batons and whips and causing the deaths of at least four protesters.

Protests and demonstrations, often led by women, pose a challenge to the new Islamist Taliban government as it seeks to consolidate control after seizing the capital Kabul nearly a month ago. read more

However, she said that some or all may have resulted from efforts to disperse protesters with firing.

She added that the United Nations had also received reports of house-to-house searches for those who participated in the protests. Journalists covering the protests have also been intimidated.

""In one case, one journalist was reported to have been told, as he was being kicked in the head, 'You are lucky you haven't been beheaded',"" Shamdasani said. ""Really there has been lots of intimidation of journalists simply trying to do their job.""

Canada's Trudeau 'not intimidated' by truckers' COVID protest,"Summary Protesters say they are in for long haul

Trudeau tests positive for COVID-19

OTTAWA, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Monday said Canadians were disgusted by the behavior of some people protesting against COVID-19 vaccine mandates in Ottawa and said he would not be intimidated.

Dozens of trucks and other vehicles have jammed up the city center since Friday. Thousands descended upon Parliament Hill to complain about Trudeau, COVID-19 vaccine mandates and masking requirements but by mid-Monday afternoon, many had left.

Police said most demonstrators have been peaceful but local residents complained about blaring truck horns and some demonstrators using the streets as a toilet. Some also harassed a homeless shelter and demanded staff give them food - the shelter said on Twitter - while others flew Nazi flags.

""We are not intimated by those who hurl abuse at small business workers and steal food from the homeless,"" Trudeau told a news conference.

""We won't cave to those who engage in vandalism ... There is no place in our country for threats, violence, or hatred.""

Senior members of the official opposition Conservative Party, which last year lost its third consecutive election to Trudeau's Liberals, praised the demonstrators.

Trudeau said Conservative leader Erin O'Toole should ""reflect very carefully on how he's walking a path that supports these people who do not represent truckers.""

But the Conservatives say Trudeau is ignoring the pain of thousands fighting for their livelihoods.

""(Canada) is a raw nerve and the prime minister is jumping up and down on it again and again with his inflammatory rhetoric,"" finance spokesman Pierre Poilievre told the House of Commons.

Trudeau earlier announced he had contracted COVID-19 but felt fine and would work remotely. For security reasons he was moved to an unspecified location on Saturday.

'AS LONG AS IT TAKES'

Ottawa police chief Peter Sloly told reporters the number of protestors had fallen significantly from Sunday and said negotiations with organizers were continuing to ensure the rest left as soon as possible.

""All options are on the table, (from) negotiation through to enforcement ... we are making real progress,"" he said.

One of the groups involved said it wanted people to go into a mall and shop without masks. The Rideau Centre, a large nearby mall, said it would be shut for a second day on Monday.

The demonstration started as a protest against a vaccine requirement for cross-border drivers, but then developed into a demonstration against Trudeau and COVID-19 policies in general.

Trucking executives say around 90% of drivers have been inoculated. The Conservatives argue the vaccine mandate is causing shortages of food imported from the United States.

Transport Minister Omar Alghabra told reporters that ""this mandate has not had a measurable impact on the volume of traffic crossing our borders.""

Truck driver Marian Tudor said he could no longer haul goods across the border because he is unvaccinated.

Tudor, 61, said he was willing to stay ""as long as it takes, until we get these mandates removed for everybody."" He accused the government of using ""fake science.""

Timeline: Key dates for Hong Kong extradition bill and protests,"HONG KONG (Reuters) - Millions of people have taken to the streets in the past three weeks to protest against a proposed extradition bill that has plunged Hong Kong into political crisis and triggered calls for embattled leader Carrie Lam to step down.

Amendments to the Fugitives Offenders Ordinance bill would have allowed individuals, including foreigners, to be sent to mainland China to face trial in courts controlled by the Communist Party. The changes were seen by many as a threat to the rule of law in the former British colony.

Lam suspended the bill after some of the largest and most violent protests in decades but has stopped short of protesters’ demands to scrap it.

Following is a timeline of the key dates around the extradition bill and the protests it triggered.

February 2019 – Hong Kong’s Security Bureau submits a paper to the city’s legislature proposing amendments to extradition laws that would provide for case-by-case extraditions to countries, including mainland China, beyond the 20 states with which Hong Kong already has treaties.

March 2019 - Thousands take to the streets of Hong Kong to protest against the proposed extradition bill. The American Chamber of Commerce expresses serious reservations in a submission to Hong Kong’s Secretary for Security, John Lee. It says the bill will “undermine perceptions of Hong Kong as a safe and secure haven for international business operations”.

April 3, 2019 – Carrie Lam’s government introduces amendments to Hong Kong’s extradition laws that would allow criminal suspects to be sent to mainland China for trial. Opponents say the changes would put them at the mercy of Chinese courts, controlled by the Communist Party, with a record of arbitrary detentions, torture and other human rights violations.

April 28, 2019 – Tens of thousands of people march on Hong Kong’s parliament to demand the scrapping of the proposed extradition laws.

May 8, 2019 – A U.S. congressional commission says the proposed extradition bill could extend China’s “coercive reach” into the financial hub and create serious risks for U.S. national security and economic interests in the city.

May 11, 2019 – Scuffles break out in Hong Kong’s legislature between pro-democracy lawmakers and those loyal to Beijing over the extradition bill.

May 14, 2019 – Hong Kong legislators clash over the proposed law, with some democrats shouting “Scrap the evil law”.

May 21, 2019 – Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam says her administration is determined to push through the bill despite mounting opposition locally and internationally. Authorities say they will bypass normal legislative procedures to expedite the bill.

May 24, 2019 - The European Union issues a formal diplomatic “demarche” protest note to Hong Kong’s leader over the extradition bill during a meeting of nearly a dozen diplomats from various EU nations, including the United Kingdom.

May 30, 2019 – Hong Kong introduces concessions to the extradition bill, including limiting the scope of extraditable offences, but critics say they are not enough. Canada and Britain say it is vital that extradition arrangements fully respect the city’s high degree of autonomy from China.

June 4, 2019 – More than 120,000 students, alumni, staff and parents from 185 secondary schools sign a petition against the extradition law.

June 6, 2019 – More than 3,000 Hong Kong lawyers take to the streets dressed in black in a rare protest march against the extradition law. Hong Kong’s last British governor, Chris Patten, says the bill is a “terrible blow” to the rule of law.

June 9, 2019 – Protest organisers say around a million people rally against the extradition bill in a march to government headquarters. Violent skirmishes break out late at night between activists and police. Police put the protest numbers at 240,000.

June 10, 2019 – Hong Kong vows to press ahead with the extradition bill despite the mass protest. The United States says it is gravely concerned about the proposed amendments.

June 11, 2019 – Lam remains defiant as she again vows to push ahead with extradition bill.

June 12, 2019 – Police fire rubber bullets and 150 canisters of tear gas as the extradition bill triggers the city’s largest and most violent protests in decades.

June 13, 2019 – Hong Kong authorities shut government offices after a day of violence. China’s foreign ministry condemns the behaviour of protesters and voices support for the government.

June 14, 2019 – Lam indefinitely delays the proposed extradition law in a dramatic retreat after violent street protests.

June 16, 2019 – Lam issues a written apology to the public after the second massive protest in a week that organisers said drew around 2 million people.

June 18, 2019 – Lam signals the end of the controversial bill but refuses to step down or say the bill is withdrawn. She apologises in person.

June 21, 2019 - Thousands of demonstrators blockade police headquarters as the city braced itself for a third weekend of mass protests.

June 24, 2019 - Beijing says it will not allow leaders at the G20 meeting in Japan to discuss the Hong Kong issue.

June 25, 2019 - Britain bans sales of tear gas to Hong Kong.

June 26, 2019 - Hong Kong activists call on G20 leaders to help “liberate” the city.

June 27, 2019 - Fresh protests hit Hong Kong as activists seek a voice at the G20.

June 28, 2019 - Anti-extradition protesters rally again near government headquarters.

"Anti-U.S. beef protest draws 100,000 S.Koreans","SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korean students, parents with toddlers in tow, and union members took to the streets on Saturday in a massive protest against a government decision to resume imports of U.S. beef that they see as dangerous.

Slideshow ( 5 images )

The organizers of the candle-lit vigil said 100,000 people were at the rally that stopped traffic on the 16-lane central Seoul main thoroughfare, after more than a week of daily protests against President Lee Myung-bak.

South Korea, once the third-largest importer of U.S. beef until a 2003 outbreak of mad cow disease in the United States, said it would start quarantine inspections of U.S. beef, a move that opens its market fully for the first time in four years.

Lee, who came to power with the largest margin of victory in history, has been caught by surprise by the protests and his popularity has plummeted over the decision to import U.S. beef.

Critics said the decision, announced during his visit to the United States in April and just before he met President George W. Bush, was a move to please Washington.

College student Ju Ha-na, 24, who took part in a head-shaving ceremony in protest with 19 others, said the people at the protest were not only alarmed by U.S. beef.

“Not just the beef deal, but the Lee Myung-bak government’s policies are anti-working people and are not right,” she said.

U.S. and South Korean officials have said U.S. beef is safe but that has not placated South Koreans.

Several hundred people have been detained from the daily protests, but police have so far refrained from using full force to contain the crowd. Officials again ordered restraint on Saturday.

The protests have grown over the past week as the government stood by largely idle and public discontent grew. People felt the government was ignoring public outcry and waiting for the protests to die down.

Chung Hye-ran, 38, at the downtown rally, said she did not like being ignored. “I came out here as a mother and as a member of the public to protect the health of my child and that of the people of this country.”

Under the deal to reopen its market, Seoul agreed with Washington to accept all cuts of beef from cattle of all ages, while other U.S. trading partners such as Japan still will not do so because of concerns over mad cow disease.

President Lee last week apologized for ignoring public health concerns and promised to restore the ban if there was a fresh outbreak of mad cow disease.

Critics said the apology came too late and did not adequately address public concern.",2008-05-31 08:53:37,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-korea-protest-idUSSEO21734120080531,49
Ethnic Mongolians in China protest removal of traditional language in schools,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Ethnic Mongolians in China’s north have staged rare protests over changes to school curriculums that remove Mongolian language from core subjects, a show of defiance that has led to curfews in some areas, according to an advocacy group.

New guidelines in the Chinese-administered Inner Mongolia region require elementary and secondary school subjects including history, politics and language to be taught in Mandarin beginning on September 1.

Videos circulated by New York-based advocacy group, the Southern Mongolian Human Rights Information Center, show angry crowds of students and parents gathering outside schools to protest the move.

The group said protesters number in the thousands. Reuters could not independently verify the figures.

Director Enghebatu Togochog told Reuters they believe the programme is part of a wider push by Beijing to wipe out Mongolian culture in the region, and said some parents pulled their children from the schools in protest.

The standardisation of national education is a key policy drive under China’s President Xi Jinping, largely focussing on promoting loyalty to China and the Communist Party.

In a Q&A posted online, Inner Mongolian regional education authorities defended the changes, saying they “reflect the will of the Party and nation ... and the inherent excellence of Chinese culture and advances to human civilisation”.

China’s Education Ministry and Ethnic Affairs Commission did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Wednesday.

Videos of the protests appeared on Chinese social media site Weibo on Monday, but have since been removed, according to Reuters checks.

The advocacy group also said videos show curfews were put in place starting on Monday in Lubei town, in the region’s east.

Traffic authorities in Fengzhen, a city southeast of regional capital Hohhot, released a notice on Monday that said they developed a plan for “emergencies involving ethnic languages” to “maintain the city’s political and social stability.”

Local civil unrest is unusual in China, where the internet is tightly controlled and police crack down on gatherings quickly.

PRESERVE THE MOTHER TONGUE

The changes have sparked protest in the independent nation of Mongolia, which shares a border with the Chinese-administered Inner Mongolia.

“We need to voice our support for Mongolians striving to preserve their mother tongue and scripture in China. The right to learn and use one’s mother tongue is an inalienable right for all,” tweeted former Mongolian president Tsakhia Elbegdorj on Tuesday.

In Mongolia’s capital, Ulaanbaatar, a small number of people gathered at the Chinese embassy on Monday to protest the changes.

“Most of us have lost the ability to speak proper Mongolian, but Inner Mongolians have kept that tradition intact. I am here to show solidarity with my southern brethren,” philosophy teacher Tseren Tuvshinjargal told Reuters.

The programme to replace ethnic languages in core courses has been deployed in Xinjiang and Tibet beginning in 2017, areas known for unrest between authorities and ethnic minorities.

“Mastering the national spoken and written language is the responsibility and obligation of every Chinese citizen. It is a concrete manifestation of love for the party and country,” said state media outlet Inner Mongolia Daily on Tuesday.",2020-09-02 03:18:17,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-education-mongolian-protests-idUSKBN25T0YP,50
"Colombians march in eighth day of protests, police deploy tear gas","BOGOTA, May 5 (Reuters) - Riot police fired tear gas at protesters in Bogota on Wednesday during an eighth day of nationwide anti-government demonstrations, after crowds attacked police stations in the capital overnight.

The protests were originally called in opposition to a now-canceled tax reform plan, but demonstrators have broadened their demands to include government action to tackle poverty, police violence and inequalities in the health and education systems. read more

Demonstrations and lawmaker opposition led to the tax reform's withdrawal and the resignation of the finance minister. International organizations have warned against police violence, which is so far linked to just under half of 24 confirmed deaths, mainly of protesters. read more

Many protesters are calling for the ESMAD riot police to be disbanded, but some said they did not blame individual officers.

""They get orders from the state, which they have to follow,"" said student James Romero, 18, who joined a chanting crowd in Bogota's central Bolivar Plaza.

Romero said he was struck several times in the back by a baton-wielding ESMAD officer while running from confrontations on Saturday.

""I felt fear - so much fear.""

Minutes later, police fired tear gas to deter some demonstrators from attempting to enter Colombia's Congress.

Earlier gatherings farther north were peaceful.

Bogota psychologist Benjamin Paba Al-Faro, 53, said he was demonstrating for better education and to ensure the continuity of the peace process with now-demobilized FARC rebels, adding: ""This isn't about defeating just one law.""

Poverty, which rose to 42.5% of the population last year amid coronavirus lockdowns, has aggravated long-standing inequalities and reversed some recent development gains.

The number of Colombians living in extreme poverty grew by 2.8 million people in 2020.

""They are temporary effects, but they could affect monetary policy depending on their duration and reach,"" Hernando Vargas said during a presentation.

POLICE STATION BURNED

President Ivan Duque has said the government will create space to listen to citizens and develop concrete proposals, similar to overtures offered to protesters following demonstrations in 2019. Many groups - including major unions - say he has failed to deliver.

In a video on Wednesday, Duque repeated government allegations that drug trafficking mafias were behind vandalism and looting and said more than 550 arrests had been made.

""There will be no truce with those who commit these crimes - all of society will take them to justice,"" Duque said.

During a seventh night of protests on Tuesday, 30 civilians and 16 police officers were injured in Bogota, the mayor's office said in a statement.

More than two dozen Bogota police stations suffered damage overnight and three were destroyed, the mayor's office said.

In one attack, a crowd tried to ""burn alive"" a group of 10 police officers by setting fire to a station, it said.

Asked about the attack, a police officer in Bolivar Plaza told Reuters he was ""disappointed as a human being.""

Mayor Claudia Lopez called the destruction and violence in the city overnight ""unbelievable.""

Protests nationwide have resulted in 24 deaths, according to the human rights ombudsman, 15 of them in the western city of Cali.

The national police or the ESMAD riot squad were listed by the ombudsman as the entity “presumed responsible” for 11 of the deaths, including that of a boy under 18 years old. A local human rights observatory said the death toll was more than 30.

Protests hit Druze city in Syria for fourth day,"AMMAN (Reuters) - Hundreds of Syrians in the mainly Druze city of Sweida took to the streets for a fourth day on Wednesday, protesting worsening economic conditions and demanding the downfall of Syrian President Bashar al Assad.

Residents said demonstrators near a main square of the southwestern city called for Assad’s overthrow, echoing chants at the start of pro-democracy protests in 2011 that were violently crushed by security forces and sparked a violent, nine-year conflict.

Syria is in the throes of a deep economic crisis that has seen its currency hit a record 3,000 Syrian pounds to the dollar earlier this week in a rapidly accelerating free-fall. It traded at 47 pounds to the dollar at the start of the conflict.

Protests since Sunday have also called for an end to rampant corruption and the pullout of Iranian militias and Russian troops, whose support has helped Assad regain most of the territory once in hands of rebels seeking to end his rule.

“Protesters called for freedom and toppling of the regime as a result of popular anger over the deteriorating economic, social, security and political situation,” said Noura al Basha, a resident and activist.

For the first time since the protests began, dozens of government supporters organised a counter demonstration in front of the provincial government offices, where they criticised a wave of new, tighter U.S. sanctions, known as the Caesar Act, which takes effect later this month.

Syrian authorities blame Western sanctions for widespread hardship among ordinary residents, where the currency collapse has led to soaring prices and people struggling to afford food and basic supplies.

State media made no mention of the opposition protest.

Sweida city had been spared the unrest seen in other parts of Syria since the start of the conflict and remained in government hands.

"With Cuban dissidents wary or in jail, call for fresh protests falls flat","HAVANA, Nov 15 (Reuters) - A rallying cry for protests in Cuba in favor of greater civil rights fell flat on Monday as most Cuban dissidents stayed home in the face of government pressure, appearing to end a standoff on the same day the Caribbean island reopened its borders to tourists.

Dissidents have for months called on social media for a ""Civic March for Change"" following street protests in July, the largest on the island in decades. Hundreds remain in jail following those rallies, according to rights groups.

Cuba's communist government banned Monday's planned demonstrations, saying they were part of a destabilization campaign by the United States, which maintains a Cold War-era embargo on Cuba. U.S. officials have denied that.

Dissidents on social media called on supporters to launch protests at 3 p.m. (2000 GMT) in 10 cities across Cuba, from the capital Havana to Pinar del Rio and Guantanamo.

More than three hours later, there was little sign of organized protests, though dissidents on social media shared videos of individuals or small groups who were quickly shouted down by pro-government supporters.

In Havana, plain-clothed and uniformed police were visible at gathering points throughout the city. Streets appeared quieter than normal as some parents kept their children home from school.

""I decided to keep my 6-year-old home from his first day at school because I was worried that something might happen,"" state worker Jennifer Puyol Vendesia said.

Demonstrations planned on Sunday by a Facebook group called Archipielago, which has led the call for protests, also fizzled out.

The timing of the protests - the same day tourism and schools were reopening after pandemic restrictions - touched a nerve with the government, according to Cuban political analyst and former diplomat Carlos Alzugaray. He said protest leaders miscalculated in the timing.

""I think Archipelago chose the wrong day,"" Alzugaray told Reuters. ""People are concerned about the reopening of the economy and the return to normalcy.""

Officials at Havana's international airport said they expected incoming flights to more than triple this week, from around 51 to 170, as tourists arrive to enjoy the island's white sand beaches and warm waters.

Cuba has vaccinated nearly its entire population against the coronavirus with its own domestically developed vaccines and says cases of COVID-19, as well as deaths, have fallen sharply, allowing it to re-open its borders to tourism, officials said.

'PEOPLE ARE SCARED'

Eunice Pulles, dressed in a white shirt on a Havana street to show her support for the dissident movement, said she thought most government opponents were too intimidated to answer the protest call.

""There will be no protests because the people are scared that we will be repressed,"" she said.

State security and groups of pro-government supporters had staked out the homes of high-profile dissidents, according to rights groups and reports on social media.

Government supporters on Sunday surrounded the home in Havana of Yunior Garcia, a playwright and Archipielago leader. That prevented him from marching alone, as he had planned, to draw support for peaceful demonstrations.

Neither Garcia nor his wife answered their phones on Monday, and fellow dissidents said on social media they had not heard from him by mid-afternoon, just prior to the start time of the protests.

On Monday morning, Saily Gonzalez, another Archipielago leader, posted on Facebook a video that appeared to show government supporters gathering outside her Santa Clara home.

In the video, the group, some dressed in red in support of the government, called her a traitor and warned her against marching. Gonzalez yelled back, telling them she would march despite their threats.

Several others posted videos of similar scenarios at their homes.

The government has not commented on those incidents. It says the protests violate Cuba's 2019 constitution and has for weeks warned against participation in the protests.

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Sunday condemned ""intimidation tactics"" by Cuba's government ahead of the planned march and vowed Washington would seek ""accountability"" for the crackdown.

Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez responded on Twitter, telling the United States to stay out of Cuban affairs.

On Monday, Rodriguez said in a televised statement the Cuban people had opted to sit out the protests, despite U.S. officials goading Cubans ""to do something that they do not want to do.""

""One can see on our streets... that none of that has occurred,"" Rodriguez said.

Vietnam protests Beijing's sinking of South China Sea boat,"HANOI (Reuters) - Vietnam has lodged an official protest with China following the sinking of a Vietnamese fishing boat it said had been rammed by a Chinese maritime surveillance vessel near islands in the disputed South China Sea.

The Vietnamese fishing vessel, with eight fishermen onboard, was fishing near the Paracel Islands on Thursday when it was rammed and sunk by the Chinese vessel, Vietnam’s foreign ministry said in a statement posted on a government website on Saturday.

All the fishermen were picked up by the Chinese vessel alive and were transferred to two other Vietnamese fishing vessels operating nearby, the Vietnam Fisheries Society said in a statement posted to its website.

“The Chinese vessel committed an act that violated Vietnam’s sovereignty over the Hoang Sa archipelago and threatened the lives and damaged the property and legitimate interests of Vietnamese fishermen,” the foreign ministry said in its statement, referring to the Paracel Islands by its Vietnamese name.

Vietnam and China have for years been embroiled in a dispute over the potentially energy-rich stretch of water, called the East Sea by Vietnam.

The Vietnamese boat illegally entered the area to fish and refused to leave, the Chinese coast guard said late on Friday.

After making some dangerous maneuvers, the boat collided with a Chinese patrol vessel and sank, the Chinese coast guard said in a statement on its social media account.

The Chinese coast guard also said it had made solemn representations with the Vietnamese side.

The incident marks the second time in less than a year a Vietnamese fishing vessel has been reportedly sunk by a Chinese vessel near the China-controlled Paracels.

A Chinese oil survey vessel conducted operations in Vietnamese-controlled waters for more than three months last year, causing a tense standoff between vessels from the two countries.",2020-04-04 01:39:24,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-vietnam-china-southchinasea-idUSKBN21M072,54
Indonesia protests against new jobs law enter second week,"JAKARTA (Reuters) - Hundreds of workers riding motorbikes and waving flags held a rally in the Indonesian capital Jakarta on Monday, as protests calling on President Joko Widodo to repeal a controversial new jobs law entered a second week.

A member of Indonesian trade unions protest against the government's labor reforms in a ""jobs creation"" bill in Jakarta, Indonesia, October 12, 2020, in this photo taken by Antara Foto/Rivan Awal Lingga/via Reuters

Designed to boost investment and cut red tape, the so-called omnibus law has sparked widespread outcry, with protesters saying the law undermines labour rights and weakens environmental protections.

Demonstrations erupted in industrial areas and cities across the archipelago last week after the bill’s passage with chaotic scenes in some areas, public property torched, and almost 6,000 people arrested.

On Monday, a union official estimated about 1,000 workers had gathered in central Jakarta for another protest against the law.

“We want the omnibus law to be revoked, and the government to issue a presidential decree to replace it,” Ema Liliefna of the Confederation of All Indonesia Trade Unions (KSBSI) told Reuters.

Widodo has defended the law, saying demonstrators were motivated by “disinformation” and urging critics to challenge the law in courts instead.

Markets and the business community greeted the new law, which revises more than 70 existing laws and regulations, with cautious optimism, but critics say the changes were rushed through and undermine existing labour laws, including on severance pay and work hours.

Protesters held rallies in other major Indonesian cities on Monday, including in Bandung and Medan, according to media reports.

In Gorontalo, on the island of Sulawesi, police arrested 60 and fired tear gas and a water cannon to disperse about 500 student demonstrators, Gorontalo police spokesman told Reuters.

Despite Widodo’s assurances that the law is needed to help create jobs as Southeast Asia’s pandemic-hit economy veers toward a recession, several groups, including Indonesia’s largest Islamic association, Nahdatul Ulama, have pledged to lodge a judicial review.

HAVANA, Aug 9 (Reuters) - ""Tired of having no electricity?"" read a post in a Facebook group for residents of the small Cuban town of San Antonio de los Banos on July 10. ""Fed up of having to listen to the impudence of a government that doesn't care about you?""

""It's time to go out and to make demands. Don't criticize at home: let's make them listen to us"".

The next day, thousands took to the street in San Antonio, a town of some 50,000 people, 30 km (20 miles) southwest of Havana, kicking off a rare wave of protests throughout the Communist-run country.

Unrest has been growing across Latin America and the Caribbean as unease spreads over COVID-19 lockdowns and rising poverty. But in Cuba authorities have traditionally tightly controlled public spaces, saying unity is key to resisting coup attempts by old Cold War foe the United States.

The protests, Cuba's most widespread since Fidel Castro's 1959 revolution, appeared largely spontaneous as Cubans vented frustrations over long lines for food, power outages, medicine shortages as well as curbs on civil freedoms.

Yet an investigation by non-state Cuban outlet El Estornudo - cited by state television and confirmed by Reuters - recently showed that the first protest was convened online by a San Antonio community forum for local people and those who had emigrated.

The Facebook group ""City of Humor"" - the nickname for San Antonio which hosts a biannual humor festival - was first created in 2017 as a social space, according to one of its three administrators, Miami-based Alexander Perez.

Over time, people also started expressing their gripes, said Perez, 44, a pastor of the Seventh-day Adventist Church. That prompted him and the other administrators Danilo Roque and Lazaro Gonzalez to try to ""educate them"" about their civil rights and claiming them through peaceful protest.

Neither Roque nor Gonzalez, whom Perez described as two younger men who lived in San Antonio operating under the pseudonyms to avoid reprisals, responded to request for comment.

The backstory shows how the recent expansion of web access in Cuba has been a gamechanger in fostering forums on social media to share criticism and to mobilize.

It also shows how strengthening relations with the Cuban diaspora - thanks to the internet and greater freedom of movement - is influencing politics on the island at a grassroots level.

Virtual communities like ""The City of Humor"" exist nationwide and emigres are exhorting local people on them to keep on protesting and expressing solidarity, with some even urging violence.

All this poses a challenge to the government which has allowed relatively unfettered access to the internet, unlike China, which blocks many Western social media apps.

Cuba has blamed the protests on online meddling by counter-revolutionaries backed by the United States, which has for decades openly sought to force reform on it through sanctions and financing for democracy programs.

The administrators of the ""City of Humor"" did not receive any U.S. funding nor had they coordinated protests with other towns, Perez said.

Cuba, where the state has a monopoly on telecommunications, has suffered intermittent disruptions in access to internet and social media since July 11, in an apparent bid to prevent further unrest.

Protests petered out within a couple of days amid those outages, a large deployment of security forces and a wave of detentions.

TEACHING CIVIL RIGHTS

Posts in ""The City of Humor"" - which jumped from around 4,000 to nearly 10,000 members after the July 11 protest - show users reminiscing, selling items, promoting businesses and complaining about local issues like water supply.

Perez said the administrators decided three years ago to also attempt to rally the community to demonstrate over shared gripes, with little success.

Last month they felt the time was ripe to try again.

The pandemic and tighter U.S. sanctions had exacerbated Cuba's economic woes, plunging it into its deepest crisis since the fall of the Soviet Union. And the COVID-19 surge was pushing its already creaking healthcare infrastructure to the brink.

""We decided this was the moment,"" said Perez.

The announcement of the protest at the church park at 11 a.m. spread by word-of-mouth and messenging applications, according to three San Antonio residents who requested anonymity.

But Perez said he had such low expectations that anyone would show up that he went to the beach that day. So he was stunned to get a call to say the small early turnout had snowballed.

""We certainly never imagined that San Antonio would be the spark that lit the flame causing Cuba to take to the streets three hours later,"" he said.

Videos on social media showed San Antonio protesters shouting anti-government slogans like ""freedom"" and ""we are not afraid"".

""My town came out in force because it just can't take any more,"" said one resident, requesting anonymity.

Within hours, President Miguel Diaz-Canel himself showed up, in a bid - he said later in a televised address to the nation - to show ""the streets belong to revolutionaries"".

Some videos on social media showed him being heckled but the unrest there and elsewhere soon dwindled amid a crackdown.

Perez said a heavy security presence in San Antonio meant Cubans would have to bide their time until another protest.

But it was noteworthy, he said, that the government already enacted reforms like lifting customs restrictions for travelers bringing in medicine and food in response to the protests.

""If we manage to achieve this in a few hours of protest"" he wondered, ""what happens if we spend three days in the streets?""

Congo protests turn violent as lawmakers select electoral commission chief,"Police rush to stop rival political supporters fighting during a protest by followers of opposition leader Martin Fayulu who were demonstrating the independence of the country’s electoral commission, in Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of Congo, October 16, 2021. REUTERS/Justin Makangara

KINSHASA, Oct 16 (Reuters) - Police in Democratic Republic of Congo used tear gas to break up clashes between supporters of the president and an opposition leader on Saturday, as lawmakers selected a new head of the electoral commission.

The National Assembly chose Denis Kadima, an election expert with decades of experience, to lead the Independent National Electoral Commission (CENI), a body that political analysts and diplomats criticised for its role in the disputed 2018 vote where Felix Tshisekedi emerged as president.

Tshisekedi is expected to seek a second term when Congolese voters return to the polls in 2023, with CENI likely to play a pivotal role again.

""His (Kadima's) electoral expertise is not disputed,"" said Tresor Kibangula, of the Congo Research Group at New York University. ""However, the fact that his candidacy was pushed behind the scenes by people close to President Felix Tshisekedi quickly raised suspicions about his independence.""

Opposition leader Martin Fayulu and Tshisekedi formed an electoral pact in the run-up to the 2018 election, but Tshisekedi eventually split off to form another political group before the vote.

Amid widespread accusations of fraud, the CENI declared Tshisekedi the winner, while Fayulu, who said he had won a landslide victory, came second.

On Saturday, around 10,000 Fayulu supporters marched through the streets of Kinshasa in protest over several issues including the accusation the process to select the leadership of the CENI was being influenced by politicians.

Police fired tear gas to break up clashes in the Limite neighbourhood between Fayulu's followers and those of Tshisekedi, who hurled petrol bombs at the protesters, according to Reuters witnesses.

Standing on the back of a truck, Fayulu told a large crowd of supporters that Congo needed an independent and transparent CENI, and a CENI president who would publish ""the real results"".

Albert Malukisa, a political science professor at the Catholic University of Congo, said Tshisekedi had already managed to gain control of the constitutional court.

""With the CENI, he can be confident of winning the next elections,"" he said.

Religious groups, who are mandated by the constitution to nominate the leadership of the CENI by consensus, have been at loggerheads for months and failed to reach agreement.

Leaders of the Catholic and Protestant churches say they have been pressured and threatened.

SANTIAGO, Oct 18 (Reuters) - Demonstrations took place across Chile on Monday to mark the second anniversary of the start of months of protests against inequality that triggered a social shift and led to formation of a representative assembly to redraft the country's constitution.

Thousands of people attended events throughout the day. Most of the gatherings were peaceful, having been convened by way of social networks in various cities. But some of Monday's demonstrations turned violent. Some looting was reported and a car set ablaze.

The 2019 protests - a mix of large, peaceful marches and smaller, violent riots - left about 30 people dead and a trail of destruction around the capital, Santiago.

""That social unrest is being channeled into building up our democracy,"" Pamela Figueroa, a political scientist at the University of Santiago, told Reuters. ""This is a moment of commemoration regarding the country we must build.""

Chile is polarized ahead of presidential and legislative elections on Nov. 21, with voters set to choose between a resurgent left pledging social change and conservatives who would stick closer to the status quo.

In the so-called Plaza de la Dignidad, the bastion of the 2019 protests in Santiago, various marches converged from different parts of the city, causing massive traffic jams, while some subway stations were closed. Protesters launched fireworks and lit bonfires, sparking some skirmishes with police.

Lawmaker and former student leader Gabriel Boric is leading the presidential race in opinion polls, supported by a leftist coalition. Far-right former lawmaker José Antonio Kast has gained as well, with one poll showing him ahead.

Last year, tens of thousands of Chileans gathered in the streets to mark the first anniversary with peaceful rallies - which by nightfall devolved into riots and looting, with mobs firebombing a police headquarters and at least two churches.

Nov 22 (Reuters) - A Netflix (NFLX.O) employee at the center of protests over its streaming of comedian Dave Chappelle's latest comedy special, has resigned and is withdrawing an unfair labor practice charge against the company.

""I have resigned from Netflix as of 11/21/2021. This isn’t how I thought things would end, but I am relieved to have closure,"" Terra Field said in a statement posted online.

Chappelle's latest Netflix comedy special ""The Closer"" was criticized by some who saw it as a ridicule of transgender people. Supporters of the comedian viewed it as a cry against cancel culture.

Field and a former colleague, B. Pagels-Minor, are withdrawing an unfair labor practice charge they filed against Netflix in late October that accused the company of retaliating against them for trying to organize a company-wide walkout over Chappelle's Netflix special.

""We have resolved our differences in a way that acknowledges the erosion of trust on both sides and, we hope, enables everyone to move on,"" Netflix spokesperson said in an emailed statement on Monday.

Neither side immediately responded to requests for further comment, including about whether there was a financial settlement in the case.

""My clients have resolved their differences with Netflix and will be voluntarily withdrawing their NLRB charge,"" Laurie Burgess, a labor lawyer representing Pagels-Minor and Field, said in a statement quoted by NBC News.

Netflix Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos had acknowledged Chappelle's provocative language in ""The Closer"" but said it did not cross the line into inciting violence.

In October, Pagels-Minor was fired while organizing the walkout after the company said Pagels-Minor had leaked confidential information, which the employee denied.

Italy imposes mandatory COVID health pass for work amid protests,"Summary All workers require new COVID health pass from Friday

Protesters say Green Pass is discriminatory

Government hopes move encourages more people to get shots

More than 80% of Italians over 12 already vaccinated

TRIESTE, Italy, Oct 15 (Reuters) - Italy made COVID-19 health passes mandatory for all workers from Friday in a test case for Europe, with the measure being applied mostly peacefully across the country despite scattered protests.

Prime Minister Mario Draghi's cabinet approved the rule - one of the world's strictest anti-COVID measures - in September, making it obligatory from Oct. 15 for all workers either to show proof of vaccination, a negative test or recent recovery from infection.

Under the rule, effective until year-end, workers without the so-called Green Pass will be suspended without pay and face a fine of up to 1,500 euros ($1,730) if they try to work on regardless.

The largest demonstrations were at the major northeastern port of Trieste, where labour groups had threatened to block operations and around 6,000 protesters, some chanting and carrying flares, gathered outside the gates.

""The Green Pass is a bad thing, it is discrimination under the law. Nothing more. It's not a health regulation, it's just a political move to create division among people...,"" said Fabio Bocin, a 59-year old port worker in Trieste.

Around 40% of Trieste's port workers are not vaccinated, said Stefano Puzzer, a local trade union official, a far higher proportion than in the general Italian population.

Vaccine hostility is also higher in the city than in most of Italy, with an ""anti-vax"" party taking 4.5% of the vote at mayoral elections this month.

Regional governor Massimiliano Fedriga told SkyTG24: ""The port (of Trieste) is functioning. Obviously there will be some difficulties and fewer people at work, but it's functioning.""

'FAIR MEASURE'

In Genoa, Italy's other main port, around 100 protesters blocked access to trucks, a Reuters witness said.

In Rome, police in riot gear stood by during a small rally where people shouted ""No Green Pass"". Small protests also took place in Turin and Bologna.

In some towns pharmacies opened earlier than usual for people to get their swab.

Outside the Rinascente department store in central Rome small lines of sales assistants and shoppers formed as employees' health certificates were checked by security staff.

""I think it's a fair measure towards all those Italians who have tried to get out of this pandemic by getting vaccinated... I don't see where the problem is,"" said Rome resident Fabio Bonanno.

Most Italians support the mandatory Green Pass, opinion polls show, but protests turned violent in Rome last Saturday when demonstrators stormed the offices of the country's largest trade union. read more

Some 15% of private and 8% of public sector workers have no Green Pass, an internal government document seen by Reuters estimates.

The government hoped making the Green Pass mandatory would convince unvaccinated Italians to change their minds, but with over 80% over the age of 12 already fully inoculated and infection rates low, that surge has not materialised.

The rightist League and Brothers of Italy parties and some unions say that, to address the risk of staff shortages, the validity of COVID tests should be extended from 48 to 72 hours, and they should be made free for unvaccinated workers.

But the government has so far resisted those calls. The centre-left Democratic Party, which is part of Draghi's ruling coalition, says that making swabs free would be the equivalent of an amnesty for tax dodgers.

However, some firms are offering free swabs to their staff. Motorcycle maker Ducati for example, said it would give free COVID tests to all employees until Nov. 15.

Exclusive: Iran-backed militias deployed snipers in Iraq protests - sources,"(Reuters) - Iran-backed militias deployed snipers on Baghdad rooftops during Iraq’s deadliest anti-government protests in years, two Iraqi security officials told Reuters.

The deployment of militia fighters, which has not been previously reported, underscores the chaotic nature of Iraqi politics amid mass protests that led to more than 100 deaths and 6,000 injuries during the week starting Oct. 1. Such militias have become a fixture here with Iran’s rising influence. They sometimes operate in conjunction with Iraqi security forces but they retain their own command structures.

The Iraqi security sources told Reuters that the leaders of Iran-aligned militias decided on their own to help put down the mass protests against the government of Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi, whose one-year-old administration is backed by powerful Iran-backed armed groups and political factions.

“We have confirmed evidence that the snipers were elements of militias reporting directly to their commander instead of the chief commander of the armed forces,” said one of the Iraqi security sources. “They belong to a group that is very close to the Iranians.”

A second Iraqi security source, who attended daily government security briefings, said militia men clad in black shot protesters on the third day of unrest, when the death toll soared to more than 50 from about half a dozen. The fighters were directed by Abu Zainab al-Lami, head of security for the Hashid, a grouping of mostly Shi’ite Muslim paramilitaries backed by Iran, the second source said. The Hashid leader was tasked with quashing the protests by a group of other senior militia commanders, the source said. The sources did not say how many snipers were deployed by militia groups.

A spokesman for the Hashid, Ahmed al-Asadi, denied the groups took part in the crackdown. “No members were present in the protest areas. None of the elements of the Hashid took part in confronting protesters,” Asadi said in a statement to Reuters.

Iraqi Interior Ministry spokesman Saad Maan said state security forces did not fire directly at protesters and blamed unnamed “vicious” shooters for the mass deaths and injuries. The government has opened an investigation to determine who shot the protesters and who ordered it, Maan said in a news conference on Oct. 6.

The assertion that security forces did not participate in the violence seemed to contradict a statement on Oct. 7 from the Iraqi security forces which said excessive force had been used and promised to hold individuals accountable for violence against civilians.

An official with the prime minister’s office said in a statement to Reuters Wednesday that it would be “premature to lay the blame on any parties, whether from Hashid or other security forces, before we end the investigation. Let’s wait and see who gave the order ‘shoot to kill.’”

Mohammed Ridha, the head of parliament’s security and defense committee, said in statement on Thursday that an initial investigation showed there were “deliberate killings of protesters by some elements”, without elaborating.

Iran’s role in responding to the demonstrations was another reminder of Tehran’s reach in Iraq, where a sizable number of former militia commanders are now members of parliament and support the Iranian agenda. Stability of the Iraqi government is in the best interests of Iran, which has been steadily amassing influence in Iraq since 2003, when the U.S.-led invasion toppled the Islamic Republic’s arch-enemy Saddam Hussein. Iran is Iraq’s biggest trading partner.

Iran’s delegation to the United Nations did not immediately respond Wednesday afternoon to questions from Reuters about its support of militias and their involvement in the violence against protesters. Leaders of militias in Iraq have denied getting training and weapons from Iran.

SNIPERS ON ROOFTOPS

As protests entered their third day, on Oct. 3, snipers appeared on Baghdad rooftops. A Reuters cameraman who was covering the unrest near Baghdad’s Tahrir Square that afternoon said he saw a sniper, wearing a balaclava and dressed in black as he stood on top of an under-construction building that overlooked the demonstrations.

Protesters fled as the sniper opened fire. One protester who was shot in the head was carried away in a large crowd. Another who was shot in the head appeared to have died and was rushed off in a truck. When his phone rang, a friend recognized that the man’s brother was calling.

“Don’t tell him he died,” the friend said.

The protests started Oct. 1 amid public rage over chronic shortages of jobs, electricity and clean water. Iraqis blame politicians and officials for systemic corruption that has prevented Iraq from recovering after years of sectarian violence and a devastating war to defeat Islamic State.

Any vacuum of power could prove challenging for the region, given that Baghdad is an ally of both the United States and Iran, who are locked in their own political standoff. Thousands of U.S. troops are stationed in the country in positions not far from those of Iran-backed Shi’ite militias.

The second security source told Reuters that the snipers were using radio communications equipment that was provided by Iran and is difficult to intercept, giving the groups an essentially private network.

A group of senior commanders from Iran’s Revolutionary Guards traveled to Iraq on the second day of the protests and met with Iraqi intelligence and security officials, according to a diplomat in the region familiar with Iran’s decision-making process. After the meeting, senior Revolutionary Guard officers with experience in curbing civil unrest continued to advise the Iraqi government, the diplomat said, although no Iranian soldiers were deployed.

A senior commander of one of the Iran-backed militias - who said his group was not involved in efforts to stop the protests or the resulting violence - said Tehran consulted closely with forces trying to quell the demonstrations.

“After two days, they jumped in and supplied the government and militias with intelligence,” the militia leader told Reuters. “Iranian advisors insisted on having a role and warned us that the ongoing protests, if not reversed, will undermine the government of Abdul Mahdi.”",2019-10-17 00:04:23,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iraq-protests-iran-snipers-exclusive-idUSKBN1WW0B1,61
Year of protests and crisis in volatile Venezuela,"CARACAS (Reuters) - Even by the volatile and violent standards of recent times in Venezuela, 2017 was an exceptional year, a “perfect storm” of political and economic crisis.

Flames erupt as clashes break out while the Constituent Assembly election is being carried out in Caracas, Venezuela, July 30, 2017. Deadly protests rocked Venezuela as opposition voters boycotted an election for a constitutional super-body that unpopular leftist President Nicolas Maduro vowed would begin a 'new era of combat' in the crisis-stricken nation. Carlos Garcia Rawlins: ""Suddenly, a bomb exploded in the capital during an opposition protest and wounded seven police officers in what seemed to be the spread of more aggressive tactics. We were taking photos from close by but the police panicked and chased everyone away, firing teargas, rubber bullets and pellets."" REUTERS/Carlos Garcia Rawlins

Going into a fourth year of crippling recession, Venezuela’s 30 million people found themselves skipping meals, suffering shortages of basic foods and medicines, jostling in lines for ever-scarcer subsidized goods, unable to keep up with dizzying inflation rates, and emigrating in ever larger numbers.

In unprecedented scenes for the once-prosperous OPEC nation, some citizens survived only by scavenging through garbage.

Not surprisingly in that context, President Nicolas Maduro’s ruling Socialists – the inheritors of Hugo Chavez’s “21st century revolution” - - lost popularity on the street, and the opposition coalition sensed a chance to unseat them.

The tipping point came in March when the pro-Maduro Supreme Court essentially took over functions of the opposition-led National Assembly. Though the controversial ruling was later modified, it was a trigger and rallying cry for the opposition, which began a campaign of street protests that ran from April to July.

Hundreds of thousands took to the streets across Venezuela, decrying economic hardship, demanding a presidential election, urging a foreign humanitarian aid corridor, and seeking freedom for scores of jailed activists.

Slogans that read “Maduro, murderer!” and “Maduro, dictator!” began appearing on roads and walls around the country. Though the majority of protesters were peaceful, youths wearing masks and brandishing homemade Viking-style shields started turning up at the front of rallies to taunt security forces.

When police and National Guard soldiers blocked marches, youths threw Molotov cocktails and stones. The security forces quickly escalated tactics, routinely turning water-cannons on the protesters and firing teargas into crowds.

Guns appeared on the streets, and on several occasions security officials were caught on camera firing directly at demonstrators. Police were targeted with homemade explosives. Opposition supporters burned one man alive.

The deaths, injuries and arrests mounted. Over the chaotic months, at least 125 people died, thousands were injured and thousands were jailed.

Global opinion hardened against Maduro. Amid the extraordinary daily events, gangs burst into the National Assembly and beat up opposition lawmakers. The nation’s best-known jailed opposition leader, Leopoldo Lopez, was released from prison and placed on home arrest to the joy of his supporters, then taken back to jail, then allowed home again, all in a matter of days.

Venezuelans grew accustomed to navigating around barricades and burning streets as they tried to get to school and work. Some days, the country virtually shut down.

By the end of July, many opposition supporters feared for their lives and protest numbers dwindled. Maduro said he was defeating a U.S.-backed coup attempt and authorities held an election, which the opposition boycotted, for an all-powerful Constituent Assembly charged with imposing order on the country.

Having failed to block the Constituent Assembly, the protests fizzled out, leaving opposition supporters nursing their wounds and planning their next moves.

They decided to tackle Maduro at the ballot-box in regional elections in October, but that backfired badly when they lost most of the governorships despite polls showing they would win. The opposition alleged fraud, but their complaints did not get traction and Maduro cemented his authority.

In November, Venezuela said it planned to renegotiate its entire foreign debt, adding another dimension to the deepening national crisis.

Police weapons used in George Floyd protests,"Racial justice protests Weapons of control What U.S. police are using to corral, subdue and disperse demonstrators

Law enforcement officers across the United States are using a variety of weapons on protesters during demonstrations against systemic racism and police brutality. George Floyd, a 46-year-old African American man, died after a white Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck for more than eight minutes. The fatal encounter has triggered a wave of protests across the country and around the world — undaunted by the coronavirus pandemic. Many of the events have been peaceful but some have turned violent, with scenes of arson, looting and clashes with police. Authorities imposed curfews on dozens of cities across the country, the most since the aftermath of the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968. Although the curfews have now been lifted, the protests continue and change is happening. Across the South, cities are removing monuments honoring the Confederate movement, which defended slavery. Some states are considering laws to make police disciplinary records public and ban chokeholds. The Democratic-led U.S. House is moving forward with sweeping reform legislation that could come to a vote by July 4, while Senate Republicans are crafting a rival plan.

Often described as non-lethal, these weapons can seriously injure, disable and even kill. Police have used them against peaceful protesters as well as members of the press during the demonstrations.

Chemical irritants

Chemical irritants include tear gas and pepper spray, which cause sensations of burning, pain and inflammation of the airways. Public health and infectious diseases experts have opposed the use of chemical irritants such as tear gas, saying in an online petition that they could increase risk for COVID-19 by “making the respiratory tract more susceptible to infection.” Because chemical irritants can spread widely, bystanders and individuals other than the intended targets can be exposed to the chemicals.

Tear gas

Tear gas has been widely and frequently used by police to disperse protesters. CS or CN gas are chemical compound powders that spray from canisters. They produce a burning sensation in the eyes and mouth that incapacitates.

Pepper spray and balls

Pepper spray is chemically distinct from tear gas, but it produces similar effects: burning and watering of the eyes and skin. Police have shot protesters with pepper spray both from handheld devices and projectiles. Police have also fired pepper balls ⁠— small projectiles containing chemical irritants. Such projectiles can contain PAVA spray, an irritant similar to pepper spray, as well as CS gas. The balls can be shot from launchers or modified paintball guns.

Protester defenses

Protesters have defended themselves against chemical irritants such as tear gas in multiple ways. Sometimes they have thrown canisters back with gloved hands, used traffic cones to trap the canister and prevent the gas from spreading, and pushed the gas away from themselves with leaf blowers.

Umbrellas have been used as shields during demonstrations. Protestors have doused themselves with milk to help diffuse the burning sensations of pepper spray.

Seattle | June 3 Memphis, Tennessee | May 31

What police are shooting

Kinetic impact projectiles include rubber, plastic, wooden, and “sponger” bullets as well as beanbag rounds, which are shot from launchers and guns. They can be fired as single shots or in groups of multiple projectiles, and can severely bruise or penetrate the skin. A 2017 survey published by the British Medical Journal found that injuries from such kinetic impact projectiles caused death in 2.7% of cases.

Rubber, plastic, and sponger bullets These kinetic weapons have been used against protesters and members of the press across the country. Reuters journalists in Minneapolis were shot by police with 40mm hard plastic projectiles during a protest in May. The mayor of Los Angeles said the city’s police department will minimize the use of rubber projectiles during peaceful protests going forward. A judge ordered Denver police to stop using chemical weapons or projectiles unless a senior officer authorizes such use of force. Portland and Seattle temporarily restricted police using tear gas on protesters.

Beanbag rounds

Beanbag rounds, also known as flexible baton rounds, are synthetic cloth bags filled with metal pellets that fit into a cartridge. They expand as they travel through the air, spreading the area of impact. A 20-year-old African-American protester was critically injured after a beanbag round struck him in the head during demonstrations in Austin, Texas. The Austin police chief confirmed that officers used beanbag rounds, adding that the person they intended to hit had thrown a water bottle and a backpack at officers — a behavior that meets the department’s criteria for using such devices. The protester who was hit was standing next to the intended target.

Wooden bullets Police forces have shot wooden bullets at protesters in Columbus, Ohio. Images online showed wooden dowel-shaped rods sliced into small, bullet-sized projectiles. The Columbus Police Department confirmed they used those devices against protesters on May 30 and said they are known as “knee knockers.”

Sting-ball grenades Protesters have reported police using sting-ball grenades, which upon explosion spray the surrounding area with rubber pellets. In addition to the rubber balls, the grenades can contain chemical agents or explode with bright light and sound.

Protester defenses

Protesters have worn helmets to protect themselves from projectiles. Some have used picnic tables as improvised shields.

New York City | June 3 Louisville, Kentucky | May 29

Disorientation devices

Disorientation devices, commonly known as flashbangs or stun grenades, explode with bright light and sound in order to stun and disorient demonstrators. They can cause severe burns when fired at close range. Constructed like a conventional grenade, they are launched or thrown into crowds. The bright flash and the loud bang can cause temporary blindness, temporary loss of hearing and loss of balance. Parts of the device can burst and fly as shrapnel.

Jordanians protest against water-for-energy deal with Israel,"Jordanians carry flags and placards as they demonstrate against the declaration of intent for water-for-energy deal signed by Israel, Jordan and the UAE, in Amman, Jordan November 26, 2021. REUTERS/Muath Freij

AMMAN, Nov 26 (Reuters) - Several thousand Jordanians protested on Friday against a water-for-energy deal with Israel and the United Emirates, calling on their government to scrap its peace agreement with Israel and saying any normalisation was a humiliating submission.

Police were deployed heavily around a downtown area of the capital Amman leading to the Husseini mosque where demonstrators marched after Friday prayers.

""No to the agreement of shame,"" protesters chanted, some carrying banners such as ""Normalisation is Treason"" in a protest organized by a mix of opposition parties including Islamists and leftists as well as tribal groups and unions.

Jordan, Israel and the UAE signed the deal last Monday in the presence of U.S. climate envoy John Kerry.

Under the agreement, Jordan would install 600 megawatts of solar power generating capacity to be exported to Israel, while Israel would provide water-scarce Jordan with 200 million cubic metres of desalinated water.

The UAE, which became the first Gulf state to normalise relations with Israel last year, was expected build the solar plant in Jordan.

The initiative is subject to feasibility studies, but if it comes to fruition it will be one of the largest regional cooperation projects undertaken between Israel and Arab countries, Western diplomats say.

""This deal is aimed at linking Jordan with the Zionist entity completely. It is not a trade deal, it is a normalization deal that is shameful and humiliating,” said Ali Abu Sukkar, a prominent Islamist opposition figure.

Many Jordanians oppose the normalisation of ties with Israel that resulted from a landmark peace deal in 1994, which opened the way for far-reaching cooperation in energy, water and gas.

Anti-Israel sentiment runs high in a country where most of the 10 million citizens are of Palestinian origin. They or their parents were expelled or fled to Jordan in the fighting that accompanied the creation of Israel in 1948.

After the deal was announced this week sporadic demonstrations sprang up at university campuses across the country in defiance of a ban on protests. Hundreds of students chanted anti-Israel slogans and called on the government to sever ties with its neighbour and scrap the project.

Turkey university protests not over despite rector's dismissal,"Students gather to protest against what they say is government interference in academia despite President Tayyip Erdogan's ousting of Melih Bulu, a rector whose appointment in January triggered months of demonstrations, in Istanbul, Turkey, July 16, 2021. The banner reads ""All the government-appointed trustees at municipalities and universities will go"". REUTERS/Umit Bektas

ISTANBUL, July 16 (Reuters) - Turkish students and academics are set to continue protests against what they say is government interference in academia despite President Tayyip Erdogan's ousting of a rector whose appointment in January triggered months of demonstrations.

Students and teachers at Istanbul's Bogazici University have defied a government ban on protests since Erdogan installed the rector Melih Bulu, an academic and former political candidate, saying the appointment process was undemocratic.

Protesters have clashed with police and hundreds have been arrested during the demonstrations. Erdogan had described them as ""terrorists"" and said he would not allow the unrest to grow into anti-government protests. read more

After Bulu's surprise dismissal was announced in a presidential decree on Thursday, his deputy Naci Inci has provisionally taken over the role of rector.

Faculty members have been protesting on campus for months, regularly gathering with their backs turned to the rector's building.

Zeynep Gambetti, associate professor of political theory at Bogazici, said Bulu's dismissal was a result of protests but that it did not mean government pressure on the university would cease.

""We were not protesting against Melih Bulu's person. We were against the method of appointment and that he was chosen not through merit but loyalty,"" she said.

""We will continue to request the resignation of all administrative staff that were appointed, including the deputy rectors,"" Gambetti said.

She added protests would continue until a rector was chosen by university members, academic freedoms were secured and the presidential power to appoint a rector was revoked.

Faculty members would work to choose their own candidate, Gambetti added.

An activist group named ""Bogazici Solidarity"" said nothing had changed and listed grievances beyond the university, including other appointments of state officials in place of elected representatives and the dismissal of various academics.

A group of around 150 protesters later gathered in Istanbul's Kadikoy district, chanting ""this is just the beginning, the struggle continues"", among other slogans.

""The struggle continues for a sovereign democratic university,"" and ""We want the king, not the pawn"", two of their signs read.

NEW FACULTIES

A pro-government commentator cited unnamed sources as saying the High Education Board had unanimously sought Bulu's dismissal and Ankara felt he failed to carry out desired steps, notably setting up law and communication faculties.

""As a Bogazici alumnus, I am concerned about the possibility of a harsher a more hawkish rector being appointed,"" commentator Nagehan Alci wrote in a column in Haberturk newspaper.

Another decree by Erdogan in February to launch new Bogazici faculties brought a legal challenge from academics concerned about political intervention in the institution's autonomy.

In Friday's Official Gazette, the Bogazici rector's office sought three teaching staff for the new law faculty in a recruitment advertisement.

The move came after a Bogazici senate meeting on July 7 voted against appointing members to the faculty, according to a record of that meeting.

Later on Friday, provisional rector Inci dismissed Can Candan, a documentary filmmaker and academic who had been outspoken during the protests.

Among the reasons for the dismissal was a disciplinary investigation over posts that allegedly insulted the university's administrators, according to a letter from Inci shared by Candan on Twitter.

It also said Candan had not applied to be re-appointed to his position after his term ended on Thursday.

Hungarians protest against planned Chinese university campus,"BUDAPEST, June 5 (Reuters) - Thousands of Hungarians, some of them holding banners declaring “Treason”, protested on Saturday against a Chinese university’s plans to open a campus in Budapest.

Liberal opponents of nationalist Prime Minister Viktor Orban accuse him of cosying up to China, and fear the campus could undercut the quality of higher education and help Beijing increase its influence in Hungary and the European Union.

""I do not agree with our country's strengthening feudal relationship with China,"" Patrik, a 22-year-old student who declined to give his full name, said at the protest in the Hungarian capital.

He said funds should be used ""to improve our own universities instead of building a Chinese one.""

The government signed an agreement with Shanghai-based Fudan University in April on building the campus at a site in Budapest where a dormitory village for Hungarian students had previously been planned.

The government has said Fudan is a world-class institution and the campus would ""allow students to learn from the best.""

MTI news agency quoted Tamas Schanda, a deputy government minister, as saying Saturday's protest was unnecessary and dismissing ""political hysteria"" based on unfounded gossip and media reports.

Opposition politicians and economists have criticised what they say will be the high costs of the project and a lack of transparency. Budapest's mayor opposes the plan.

""Fidesz is selling out wholesale the housing of Hungarian students, and their future, just so it can bring the elite university of China's dictatorship into the country,"" the organisers of Saturday's protest said on Facebook.

Beijing said this week ""a few Hungarian politicians"" were trying to grab attention and obstruct cooperation between China and Hungary.

Orban has built cordial ties with China, Russia and other illiberal governments, while locking horns with Western allies by curbing the independence of scientific research, the judiciary and media.

He faces a unified opposition for the first time since assuming power in 2010 before a parliamentary election due in 2022.

Thousands protest in Chicago as NATO summit opens,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Thousands of protesters carried their anti-war message to world leaders at a NATO summit on a steamy Sunday, in a mostly peaceful march led by a group of Iraq War veterans who symbolically gave back their military medals.

During the march, a group of black-clad demonstrators darted toward police lines along the route, and some threw water bottles at officers who pushed back and yelled at them to move along, but there were no major incidents.

Police estimated the crowd at 2,500 to 3,000 people, although it appeared to be larger, in what was the biggest rally so far in the week leading up to the NATO summit. Among them was Chicago-based civil rights leader Rev. Jesse Jackson, who walked in summer-like heat with a few women bearing a sign reading “Afghans for Peace.”

Riot police made a bigger show of force and watched the march closely than earlier in the week. They were also more open in displaying their equipment including body armor.

Demonstrators ranged from those in festive costumes and a few parents pushing strollers with babies to others in all black with bandannas over their faces and carrying signs including “Anarchists alliance, D.C.”

Demonstrators had little chance of being seen by the world leaders and representatives from some 60 countries at the meeting of the military alliance. The summit site, the McCormick Place convention center, is inside a security zone guarded by tall fences. Protesters were kept blocks away from the convention center.

President Barack Obama, who is hosting the summit in his hometown, kicked off the meeting by greeting NATO members one by one. NATO leaders are seeking to chart a path out of the unpopular war in Afghanistan.

The Coalition Against NATO-G8, the group behind Sunday’s parade that they hoped would draw 10,000 people, advocated for an immediate end to the U.S. role in the Afghan war.

Other protesters, including participants in Occupy Wall Street demonstrations from around the nation who descended on Chicago for the summit, decried U.S. defense spending and economic inequality.

The protesters hoisted flags and signs, including one pink hand-painted sign shaped like a woman’s torso reading “Bust Up NATO.” A woman fanned herself in the midday 90-degree (32 C) heat with a “No War, No Peace” sign.

In a brief skirmish, some black-clad, bandanna-wearing protesters pushed and screamed at police.

Some of the black-clad youths yelled at a group of veterans folding a flag, chanting “Burn it!” Some of the youths tussled with other protesters who blocked their path.

Some protesters carried large U.S. flags, some held upside down. Groups of drummers pounded away and Occupy Chicago anti-Wall Street protesters wore clown makeup.

At the outskirts of the protest rally, police clambered out of vans and buses. Dozens of officers on bicycles that have been employed extensively against protests so far this past week were at the ready.

Matt Howard, a former U.S. Marine who served in Iraq, was one of more than three dozen veterans who threw his service medal onto the street near the summit site in a symbol of protest.

Vietnam War veteran Ron McSheffery, 61, said, “I’m in total support of stopping NATO and stopping the slaughter of innocent civilians. If we took the money we spent on bombs and put it into green energy, we wouldn’t need to keep the sea lanes open” for oil transport.

POLICE READY FOR PROTESTS

Previous protests in the run-up to the summit Sunday and Monday have been lively but peaceful, resulting in fewer than two dozen arrests in the past six days, according to the Chicago Police Department.

“I think we’re going to be able to handle it,” Police Chief Garry McCarthy told reporters, adding the numbers of demonstrators this week were fewer than many had expected.

“We’re going to take care of business. We’re well-trained, we’re well-equipped. I’ll say this again - we’re just not going to tolerate illegal behavior.”

One officer suffered a concussion Saturday when the police van he was driving was engulfed by a downtown protest. A protester also was hurt when the van sped off.

Five men have been arrested on terrorism-related or bomb-making charges. Three of those charged were plotting to attack Obama’s campaign headquarters, police stations and other targets, according to court documents. Defense lawyers said the three were entrapped by police informants.

An affiliate of the computer hacking group Anonymous said it had brought down the website for Chicago’s police department and another city website to protest the summit. The websites were back up a few hours later.

Fears that violence would erupt have so far proved unfounded as police have absorbed torrents of verbal abuse screamed at them by protesters. Experts credited the low arrest numbers to restraint by both police and protesters.

McCarthy said at the beginning of the week that his goal was to “extract” those protesters who were provocative and let others demonstrate peacefully.",2012-05-20 00:42:56,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-nato-summit-protests-idUSBRE84I09X20120520,67
Greenpeace protests against France's uranium exports to Russia,"Demonstrators protest outside an Orano office in Chatillon, France October 12, 2021. Victor Point / Greenpeace/Handout via REUTERS

PARIS, Oct 11 (Reuters) - Greenpeace activists protested outside the headquarters of one of France's state-owned nuclear companies on Tuesday, calling for the country to stop all exporting and plans to export its reprocessed uranium to Russia.

Environmental activists sat in hazmat suits beside dummy radioactive waste containers in front of Orano's offices just south of Paris, in a photo Greenpeace shared on Twitter.

They carried banners reading ""Nuclear is not green"", ""Stop radioactive trafficking"" and ""Russia is not a bin"".

In a statement, the group called for France's environment ministry to reclassify reprocessed uranium as waste and organise its long-term storage in France - rather than shipping the stocks to a site in Siberia for conversion into nuclear fuel.

Citing France and Russia's existing uranium reserves, Greenpeace said the reprocessed material could be stored for an ""unlimited time"" in Siberia where it may cause environmental harm.

Nuclear reprocessing is the chemical separation of products from spent nuclear fuel, which generates reusable uranium and plutonium that can be used in power plants and nuclear weapon projects.

New uranium was for years a cheaper alternative to the reprocessing and re-enriching of used uranium.

Greenpeace said most of the uranium sent to Russia would stay there without being reused, and that transporting the nuclear material was ""environmental, social and economic nonsense"".

Orano said it had sold just over 1,000 tonnes of reprocessed uranium to Russian state nuclear firm Rosatom late last year for conversion into fuel.

It stressed that the material was reusable and that higher natural uranium prices now made conversion more attractive.

EDF (EDF.PA), which signed a deal with Rosatom's subsidiary Tenex in 2018, said it would not send its first shipments before it received guarantees the site there respected ""technical and environmental"" requirements.

The materials would be converted to fuel in Russia before being sent back to EDF's own nuclear plants in France.

France derives around 70% of its power from some 56 working nuclear reactors, though the government aims to cut this to 50% by 2035.

Thousands in El Salvador join protests against Bukele government,"SAN SALVADOR, Oct 17 (Reuters) - Thousands of people in El Salvador took to the streets on Sunday in protest against President Nayib Bukele who has stoked concern that he is steadily concentrating power and who responded with changing his Twitter profile late in the day to ""Emperor of El Salvador"".

Local media estimated at least 4,000 people marched through capital San Salvador. They bore banners and signs decrying Bukele's ouster of Supreme Court judges, the potential for the president to seek a second consecutive term and the adoption of bitcoin as legal tender.

Bukele's apparent joke with his Twitter profile follows an update last month when he changed it to say ""Dictator"" of El Salvador.

Sunday's protesters chanted slogans including ""What does El Salvador want? Get rid of the dictator!"" Near the capital's main square, some set fire to an effigy bearing the likeness of the 40-year-old president.

It was at least the second large protest in just over a month, following marches in September that denounced bitcoin being made legal tender alongside the U.S. dollar.

In May, a Congress dominated for the first time by Bukele's New Ideas party voted to fire the judges on the constitutional panel of the Supreme Court, among the most senior jurists in the country, as well as the then-attorney general. Replacements seen as friendly to Bukele were swiftly voted in to replace them, which generated harsh criticism from the United States as well as top international rights groups.

Bukele's administration then came under fire from the United States after the Supreme Court judges ruled that the president could seek a second consecutive term, which Washington saw as unconstitutional.

""We are totally losing rights because today they do not respect the laws. Here, what's done is the will of Nayib,"" said Rosa Granados, a labor union member who participated in the protests.

""If he raises his hand, all the deputies approve it and there is no law and no legal process that is respected,"" she added.

Bukele, a seasoned and often provocative user of social media, dismissed the protests as a ""failure"" on Twitter.

""The march is a failure and they know it..... Nobody believes them here anymore,"" he wrote.

How Trump allies have organized and promoted anti-lockdown protests,"HARRISBURG, Pa./DETROIT (Reuters) - Republican politicians and individuals affiliated with President Donald Trump’s re-election campaign are organizing or promoting anti-lockdown protests across key electoral battleground states, despite the White House’s own cautious guidance on relaxing restrictions, interviews with two dozen people involved show.

FILE PHOTO: Supporters of the Michigan Conservative Coalition protest against the state's extended stay-at-home order, amid the spread of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), at the Capitol building in Lansing, Michigan, U.S. April 15, 2020. REUTERS/Seth Herald/File Photo

In Michigan, the organizers of last week’s rally against Democratic Governor Gretchen Whitmer’s stay-at-home order aimed at combating the coronavirus pandemic are involved in the Republican president’s re-election effort, a Reuters review of their profiles and interviews with them show.

In other swing states, such as Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and North Carolina, Republican lawmakers, party leaders and Trump allies encouraged their social media followers to join the protests, often organized by conservative activists and pro-gun- rights groups, and attended the events themselves.

Their actions contradict the Trump administration’s recommendations for a slow and phased reopening, as well as warnings from its own medical experts that opening the economy too fast risks a resurgence of the novel coronavirus that has infected almost 810,000 people in the United States and killed over 45,000 - the world’s highest number of cases and deaths.

A bipartisan majority of Americans - 88% of Democrats and 55% of Republicans - also want to continue to shelter in place despite the impact on the economy, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Tuesday.

Regardless, many Trump supporters saw his criticism of Democratic governors for going too far with economic restrictions, and his recent tweets calling for those states to be “liberated,” as endorsing their cause, protest organizers and Republican officials said.

They said there had been no communication with the Trump administration or his election campaign over the protests.

The Trump campaign declined to answer whether it had been involved with the protests, referring instead to Trump’s daily coronavirus briefings in which he has expressed sympathy for the protesters, saying he understands their frustration.

Several of the main organizers of the Lansing, Michigan, protest that police estimated drew about 4,000 people have ties to the Trump campaign, and are deeply involved in state Republican politics.

Among them is Meshawn Maddock, who sits on the national advisory board of Women for Trump 2020, an organizing and fundraising arm of Trump’s re-election.

Maddock, whose Twitter profile pictures her with Trump and also says she is a co-chair of his campaign in Michigan, said the Trump campaign had given her no messaging and she was only acting in her capacity as a concerned citizen.

Marian Sheridan, who was a founder of Michigan Trump Republicans and serves as the grassroots vice chair for Michigan’s Republican Party, was also involved in organizing the protest.

She described the protest as an apolitical backlash to Whitmer’s guidance, seen as one of the strictest in the country. Whitmer is widely seen as a possible running mate for presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden in November’s election.

“You see the people with the Trump signs, but people shouldn’t just jump to conclusions that these are only Republicans out there. Everyone is being so hurt by this,” Sheridan said.

Chris Gustafson, the Trump campaign’s Michigan spokesman, reiterated that neither the Republican National Committee nor Trump’s national campaign had any role in the Michigan protest.

‘HE ALONE CAN FIX ECONOMY’

Still, the Trump campaign has seized on the anti-shutdown backlash to drive new talking points on the economy: Democrats are killing small businesses, while Trump is the only leader able to both fix the coronavirus-ravaged economy and slow down the pandemic, emails sent by Trump campaign aides show.

After running more than 4,000 Facebook ads in January and February touting a strong economy, Trump has not mentioned the economy in a new ad since March 3, according to a Reuters analysis of ad data gathered by researchers at New York University, as jobless claims surged and stocks tumbled.

A Trump campaign pollster, who asked not to be identified, said the current economic picture was bleak but could favor Trump.

“Voters won’t hold him accountable for the collapse - and they shouldn’t - and he is best suited to make the argument that he can bring the economy back,” the pollster said.

In Wisconsin, a state Trump won by less than a percentage point in 2016, Stephen Moore, a member of Trump’s council to reopen the economy and an outside economic adviser to the president, urged people to join an anti-shutdown rally planned for Friday, in a video posted on YouTube last week.

Mark Jefferson, chairman of the Wisconsin Republican Party, said voters would look fondly at Trump’s efforts to reopen the economy when they go to the polls in November.

“The messaging for Republicans is becoming clear for the election: Voters are going to appreciate a president concerned about their economic health as well as their physical health,” Jefferson said.

The Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, which oversees efforts to elect more Democrats at the state level, said Americans overwhelmingly supported stay-at-home orders and accused Republicans of putting “profits over lives.”

“We’re going to make sure voters hold them accountable for their recklessness this November and beyond,” said Jessica Post, the group’s president.

‘LET’S MAKE PENNSYLVANIA GREAT AGAIN’

Organizers say their rallies are non-partisan. But with many wearing Trump 2020 hats and waving his campaign flags, they look and sound like Trump’s signature campaign rallies.

At Monday’s protest in Harrisburg, the Pennsylvania state capital, several state Republican lawmakers addressed the crowd. Some borrowed Trump’s favorite taglines.

“Let’s reopen this economy. Let’s make Pennsylvania great again,” said Republican state Senator Doug Mastriano, a vocal Trump supporter who sponsored legislation forcing the reopening of the state. It passed both houses but was vetoed by the state’s Democratic governor, Tom Wolf.

Matthew Bellis, one of the Harrisburg protest organizers, said politicians were smart to recognize and tap into their anger.

“If Trump supports us, we are happy to have his support, though we are not seeking it,” said Bellis. “In fact, I think politicians are taking cues from us, not the other way around.”",2020-04-21 19:56:16,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-trump-protests-idUSKCN2233ES,71

Sporadic protests against the Taliban, who swept to power in Afghanistan with the capture of Kabul almost a month ago, have ended in occasionally deadly clashes, although there were no confirmed reports of violence on Tuesday.

BOGOTA, May 30 (Reuters) - Waving flags and dressed in white, thousands marched in Colombia's capital Bogota on Sunday to demand an end to protests and roadblocks, as well as to express support for security forces, following a month of demonstrations.

""They (the roadblocks) are taking the cities hostage. They are stopping the economy,"" Patricia Gonzalez, 45, said.

The roadblocks have caused shortages of food and supplies in some parts of the country.

Though acknowledging the use of excessive force by some police, Gonzalez said not all police were corrupt and that the protests had gone on long enough.

Talks between the government and national protest leaders are to restart on Sunday, after stalling last week. read more

Widespread protests began at the end of April in opposition to a now-withdrawn tax reform but have since expanded to call for a basic income, opportunities for young people and to end police violence.

The month of protests have been beset with violence. The national government has so-far linked 17 civilian deaths and the deaths of two police officers to the protests, while rights groups say security forces have killed dozens of civilians.

In Colombia's third-largest city, Cali, 13 people were killed during a day of protests on Friday, Mayor Jorge Ivan Ospina said on Saturday, stressing it was not certain how many of these were linked to demonstrations. read more

The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Michelle Bachelet, on Sunday called for those responsible for the violence in Cali to be held accountable.

""I call for an end to all forms of violence,"" she said in a statement, calling for an investigation into the deaths and injuries.

While a ""pre-agreement"" to further negotiations was reached on Monday, strike organizers have since accused the government of deliberately stalling talks by not signing the deal.

The government says protest leaders must condemn roadblocks as part of the pre-agreement, calling the point non-negotiable.

Dozens protest against Chinese influence in Kazakhstan,"ALMATY/NUR-SULTAN (Reuters) - Kazakhs protesting against the construction of Chinese factories held public rallies in three Kazakh cities on Wednesday, demanding a ban on an initiative which the Central Asian nation’s government hoped would bring investment and jobs.

Neighboring China is already one of the oil-rich former Soviet republic’s biggest investors and trade partners, but its broad presence and Beijing’s campaign to “de-radicalise” ethnic minorities in the Xinjiang province have contributed to a growing anti-Chinese sentiment.

The protests first started in the small industrial town of Zhanaozen in Western Kazakhstan on Sunday as about 100 people gathered to demand a ban on what they described as plans to move outdated and polluting Chinese plants to Kazakhstan.

On Monday, the crowd grew to more than 300 people, according to local newspaper Lada. Speaking to the protesters, regional governor Serikbai Trumov said there were no such plans - although the government has said it was discussing a number of investment projects with Chinese companies.

But rallies continued on Wednesday, widening to include the capital, Nur-Sultan, and the country’s biggest city, Almaty.

In Almaty, about 30 people gathered outside the mayor’s office holding banners such as “No Chinese plants” and singing the national anthem. In Nur-Sultan, about two dozen people rallied at one of the central squares, displaying banners with similar messages.

China is a major investor in Kazakhstan’s energy sector and buys oil and gas from the mostly Muslim nation of 18 million, but critics accuse some Chinese companies - as well as Western ones - of hiring too few local staff and paying them less than foreign workers.

Also driven by anti-Chinese sentiment was a series of protests in 2016 against a planned land reform which its opponents said would have allowed foreigners to scoop up huge swathes of Kazakh farmland. The reform was shelved.

Beijing’s “de-radicalisation” drive in Xinjiang, which according to human rights groups has landed a million people, including some ethnic Kazakhs, in prison-like camps, has also been a source of tension.

Last March, Kazakhstan arrested a leading campaigner against the camps, charging him with hate speech. A local court set him free in a plea bargain last month.",2019-09-04 06:49:07,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-kazakhstan-china-protests-idUSKCN1VP1B0,74
"Five killed in protests against military rule in Sudan, doctors say","KHARTOUM, Dec 31 (Reuters) - Five people were killed during a crackdown by Sudanese security forces on nationwide protests against military rule on Dec. 30, a doctors' committee said on Friday.

Security forces had fired tear gas and stun grenades as protesters marched through Khartoum and the neighbouring cities of Omdurman and Bahri towards the presidential palace on Thursday, Reuters witnesses said.

Police said in a statement that four people were killed in Omdurman, and 297 demonstrators and 49 police were wounded nationwide in the protests, which involved tens of thousands of people.

The Central Committee of Sudanese Doctors, which is aligned with the protest movement, said a fifth person was killed after being hit in the chest by a tear gas canister fired by security forces during the protests on Thursday. It did not say where.

Al Hadath TV quoted an adviser to military leader Abdel Fattah Al-Burhan as saying the military would not allow anyone to pull the country into chaos and that continued protests were a ""physical, psychological, and mental drain on the country"" and ""would not achieve a political solution"".

Thursday's protests marked the 11th round of major demonstrations since an Oct. 25 coup that saw Abdallah Hamdok removed and then reinstated as prime minister. The demonstrators have demanded that the military play no role in government during a transition to free elections.

The Forces of Freedom and Change coalition said that security forces ""used excessive repression"" on Thursday and called on ""regional and international communities and human rights organizations to condemn the coup"".

U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken wrote on Twitter that he was troubled by reports of lethal force and the United States ""stands with the people of Sudan, as they demand freedom, peace, and justice"".

The U.N. Special Representative to Sudan, Volker Perthes, said that he was ""deeply disturbed"" by the deaths.

INTERNET SHUTDOWN

Security forces confronted the protesters about 2 kilometres (1.2 miles) from the palace in the centre of the capital, a Reuters witness said.

The Khartoum State Ministry of Health said in a statement that security forces in Omdurman had prevented ambulances from carrying the wounded to nearby hospitals, adding that the ""scale of repression exceeded expectations"".

Sudan's Sovereign Council denounced in a statement on Friday the violence that accompanied Thursday's protests.

The council said that it ordered authorities to take all legal and military procedures necessary to avoid a recurrence of such events ""so that nobody will go unpunished"".

The council this week reinstated powers of arrests, detentions and seizures to the intelligence service. The intelligence service justified the decision by saying that the political situation could turn ""catastrophic"".

Internet and mobile services were apparently disrupted in Khartoum on Thursday.

Reuters witnesses were unable to make or receive domestic and international calls and a source at a telecoms company said an order to shut down internet services had come from the state-owned Sudan National Telecommunications Corporation.

Some people managed to post images on social media showing protests in several other cities, including Port Sudan, Zalenjei, and Kassala.

""I come for the martyred. I'm not going to be tired because some people gave their lives for this. Being tired is nothing compared to that,"" said a nurse in Bahri on Thursday, who said she has attended all 11 protests and gave her name as Jihad.

Al Jazeera's Sudan bureau chief arrested after protests,"The Al Jazeera Media Network logo is seen inside its headquarters in Doha, Qatar June 8, 2017. REUTERS/Naseem Zeitoon

CAIRO, Nov 14 (Reuters) - Sudanese security forces raided the home of Al Jazeera's Khartoum bureau chief and arrested him on Sunday, the Qatar-based news channel said, a day after street protests across Sudan against a military takeover.

Security forces used tear gas and gunfire to try to disperse the protests in the capital Khartoum and other cities.

The Central Committee of Sudanese Doctors, which is aligned with the protest movement, said the number of demonstrators killed on Saturday had risen to seven with the death of a 13-year-old girl from a bullet wound to her head. read more

More than 200 people were injured, more than 100 of them from gunshot wounds, the committee said. At least 11 were in serious condition. The death toll for those killed in protests since the Oct. 25 coup was 22, they said.

Pro-democracy groups led by neighbourhood resistance committees are organising a campaign of civil disobedience and protests against military rule, with another day of demonstrations planned for Nov. 17.

The coup ended a military-civilian power-sharing arrangement set up after the overthrow of autocratic ruler Omar al-Bashir in 2019. Western powers that had backed Sudan's political transition towards elections after Bashir's ouster have condemned the military takeover and suspended economic assistance.

The European Union on Sunday condemned ""in the strongest terms the violence perpetrated against peaceful civilian protesters"" on Saturday, and said it was ""very worried"" by the detention of journalists.

""The interventions by the military since 25 October last are undoing much of the progress achieved under the civilian-led government,"" the bloc said in a statement. ""This will have serious consequences for the support of the European Union.""

Separately, a group that represents refugees and displaced people in the western Darfur region, where security has deteriorated in recent months, said that four civilians had been killed in several incidents over the past week and a refugee camp had been attacked.

Efforts to mobilise opposition to the coup have been complicated by a mobile internet blackout across the country. On Sunday a judge issued a third order for providers to restore connections.

Since the takeover, military leader Abdel Fattah al-Burhan has moved to consolidate his position, replacing key state officials and naming a new ruling council, which held its first meeting on Sunday.

The council is expected to name a new prime minister after efforts involving the United Nations to mediate between the military and ousted Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok stalled.

Hamdok, who is under house arrest, had demanded the release of other top civilians arrested during the coup and a return to power sharing ahead of elections in 2023.

Al Jazeera said it held Sudan's military authorities responsible for the safety of all its employees after bureau chief El Musalmi El Kabbashi was arrested.

""Al Jazeera condemns in the strongest terms the reprehensible actions of the military and calls on the authorities to release El Kabbashi immediately and to allow its journalists to operate unhindered,"" it said in a statement.

Protests against police abuse spread across Tunisian capital,"TUNIS, June 15 (Reuters) - Protests that erupted more a week against police abuse in Sejoumi neighbourhood of Tunisia's capital spread other poor neighborhoods late on Wednesday.

The protesters gathered in Ettadhamen and Intilaka neighborhoods, blocked roads, burned tires and threw stones at police, as officers chased demonstrators and unleashed tear gas, a Reuters reporter at the scene said.

Protests escalated last week after a video circulated online showed police stripping and beating a young man, triggering widespread anger among the public.

On Tuesday, hundreds gathered in Sijoumi, raising slogans against the government and calling on officials to stop police abuse and punish those involved. They chanted ""Freedom, freedom, the police state is over.""

A man arrested by police on suspicion of dealing drugs died few hours after being arrested last week. The family accused the police of beating him to death. Tunisia's interior ministry has denied the allegation.

The United Nations human rights office in Tunisia said on Monday it is concerned about repeated allegations of serious violations by the Tunisian police amid violent protests.

Forty-three organizations, including the Journalists Syndicate, unions and the lawyers syndicate and the Human Rights League, called for a massive national protest on Friday to end what they say is police impunity. They said that they filed a lawsuit against the Prime Minister Hichem Mechichi, who is also the acting interior minister.

A decade on from the Arab Spring revolutionary protests against poverty, injustice and police state, Tunisia has made progress towards democracy but its economic problems have worsened, which has led to repeated protests.

During the most recent January protests, the police arrested more than 2,000 people, most of them minors. Human rights organizations said that hundreds of them were subjected to ill treatment and torture.

Human rights activists said police abuses have threatened to undermine the democratic gains made since the overthrow of President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali's repressive regime a decade ago.

AMSTERDAM, Jan 2 (Reuters) - Riot police with batons and shields broke up a crowd of several thousand who had gathered in Amsterdam on Sunday to protest against COVID-19 lockdown measures and vaccinations.

Public gatherings of more than two people are prohibited under restrictions imposed by the Netherlands in an effort to prevent the Omicron variant of the coronavirus overwhelming an already strained healthcare system.

At least 30 people were detained after scuffles, during which four officers were injured, police said in a statement.

The protesters, who mostly did not wear masks or abide by social distancing rules, ignored an order not to hold a march and walked along a main thoroughfare, playing music and holding yellow umbrellas in a sign of opposition to government measures.

The Netherlands went into a sudden lockdown on Dec. 19, with the government ordering the closure of all but essential stores, as well as restaurants, hairdressers, gyms, museums and other public places until at least Jan. 14. read more

Canada rally against vaccine mandates blocks Ottawa as Trump praises protest,"OTTAWA, Jan 30 (Reuters) - Dozens of trucks and other vehicles blocked the downtown area of Ottawa for a second day after thousands descended on Canada's capital city on Saturday to protest against Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and COVID-19 vaccine mandates.

Trucks remained parked on the streets near parliament on Sunday, a day before lawmakers are due to resume work after the holiday break. Hundreds of protesters were out on Sunday, too. Some truckers said they will not leave until the mandate is overturned.

Former U.S. President Donald Trump, speaking at a rally in Texas on Saturday, praised the Canadian protesters for ""resisting bravely these lawless mandates"", in a sign the politicization of the pandemic seen mostly south of the border has spread north.

In solidarity with the Ottawa rally, truckers and protesters have blocked a Canada-U.S. border crossing in southern Alberta, police said on Twitter.

In Ottawa, thousands gathered peacefully on Saturday and there were no arrests, though several incidents are now being investigated by police.

""Several criminal investigations are underway,"" Ottawa police said on Twitter, including for the ""desecration of the National War Memorial"" and ""threatening/illegal/intimidating behaviour to police/city workers and other individuals"".

One protester was filmed dancing on the war memorial - the tomb of the unknown soldier - and flags bearing swastikas were seen in the crowd. A downtown mall shut down because protesters refused to wear masks.

Michael Cooper, a Conservative lawmaker who handed out coffee at the protest, was pictured standing near a Canadian flag bearing a Swastika during a TV interview. He later released a statement condemning the ""reprehensible"" protester on Twitter.

Canada's top soldier, Chief of the Defence Staff General Wayne Eyre, denounced a woman filmed dancing on the tomb of the unknown soldier, saying he was ""sickened"".

""We do not condone any disrespectful behavior,"" the official Facebook page for the rally said on Saturday.

The demonstration started out as a protest against a vaccine requirement for cross-border drivers, but turned into a demonstration against the Trudeau government with a strong anti-vaccination streak.

Due to security concerns, Trudeau and his family left their downtown Ottawa home on Saturday. Earlier this week Trudeau said the convoy represented a ""small fringe minority"" who do not represent the views of Canadians.

About 90% of Canada's cross-border truckers and almost 79% of the population has had two COVID-19 vaccine shots. Canada is now in the middle of a spike in Omicron variant cases that is straining hospitals.

Transport Minister Omar Alghabra ruled out reversing any of the mandates on Sunday.

""Vaccines are our best way to protect ourselves and our economy from COVID-19,"" Alghabra said in an interview with the CanaBC. ""It is unacceptable to see the swastika being flown anywhere,"" he added.

Canada's Conservative Party supported the protest, which aimed a lot of its anger - in signs and chants - directly at Trudeau. The right-wing People's Party of Canada, which holds no seats in parliament, turned out at the rally.

""We are super-spreaders of freedom,"" People's Party leader Maxime Bernier said in a speech on Saturday.

Ottawa Mayor Jim Watson said some protesters had harassed a soup kitchen, demanding free meals because their refusal to wear masks meant they were not to order in restaurants, according to an interview with the CBC.

""You have the right to protest, you've had your protest, please move on,"" Watson said.

"'We are not guinea pigs,' say South African anti-vaccine protesters","JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Anti-vaccine protesters took to the streets in Johannesburg on Wednesday to voice their concern over Africa’s first human trials for a potential coronavirus vaccine.

Last Wednesday, the University of the Witwatersrand in partnership with Oxford University rolled out South Africa’s first clinical trial, which will consist of 2,000 volunteers.

The involvement of South Africa in vaccine trials is intended to ensure the continent will have access to an affordable vaccine and not be left at the back of the queue.

About 50 people held protests at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, saying they did not want Africans to be used as guinea pigs, reflecting concerns among some on the continent over testing drugs on people who do not understand the risks.

“I’m not happy at all! I mean this feels like the 1980s all over again when the AIDS pandemic just broke out in South Africa,” said 29-year-old graphic designer Tebogo Legoale.

Some of the placards carried by demonstrators read: “We are not guinea pigs.”

Twenty-nine-year-old community activist Walter Mashilo said the vaccine should be tested first on members of parliament and ministers’ children, not on poor people.

“We are clear, comrades, we don’t want this vaccine (trial),” he said, addressing the crowd.

South Africa has the highest rate of infections on the continent, with confirmed cases at over 150,000 and more than 2,600 deaths.

Traditional healers are also fighting for their medicine to be used against the virus instead of a vaccine.

“We are not going to follow a vaccine because we as healers believe that our traditional medicine is not given a chance,” said Sellwane Mokatsi, 32-year-old compliance officer, who is also part of the traditional healers’ organisation.",2020-07-01 12:43:58,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-safrica-vaccine-idUSKBN2426RY,80
"Arrest of military pilot sparks protests in Djibouti: lawyer, social media","NAIROBI (Reuters) - The tiny Horn of Africa nation Djibouti has witnessed days of anti-government protests after a detained air force pilot said in a video clip he had been tortured, his lawyer said on Monday.

The government did not respond to a request for comment but Djibouti’s ambassador to neighbouring Ethiopia told Reuters the pilot, Fouad Youssuf Ali, had been arrested for treason. The envoy denied that Fouad had been tortured.

“Many spontaneous protests in support of Fouad’s unlawful detention and mistreatment have taken place in Djibouti,” said the lawyer, Zakaria Ali, adding that some 200 people including members of the pilot’s family had been arrested in recent days.

“I visited him on May 13 and saw severe signs of torture on his legs,” Ali added.

Grainy footage posted on social media sites appeared to show people protesting in the streets of Djibouti.

According to social media, the protests started last week after a video clip began circulating online showing the pilot being held in what appeared to be a toilet of a jail.

Asked about the case, Djibouti’s ambassador to Ethiopia, Mohamed Idriss Farah, said the pilot had been arrested on April 9 in the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa, where he had escaped after attempting to steal and fly a plane to Eritrea.

“He was extradited to Djibouti the following day on charges of treason, as he incited people to rebellion in a video he took in the plane,” Farah said.

“Claims that the pilot has been tortured while in detention are false,” he added. “Those protests were sparked by social media mainly from the diaspora who spread fake news in Djibouti.”

Djibouti is home to both Chinese and U.S. naval bases. Its strategic position on the Gulf of Aden means it overlooks the world’s busiest shipping lanes for oil cargos, but many of its citizens are impoverished and human rights groups say abuses by the security forces are common.

Independent news sites are blocked in Djibouti and journalists often arrested and beaten, global media watchdog Reporters Sans Frontieres says.

On Monday, the group put out a statement saying two independent Djiboutian journalists covering the story of the pilot had been arrested -- Kassim Nouh Abar on June 5 and Mohamed Ibrahim Wais on June 8.

Rashid Abdi, a Nairobi-based Horn of Africa political analyst, warned that there was already widespread anger over poverty and corruption.

“We should not underestimate the ability of the government to be very brutal in its response if the unrest continues,” he said.",2020-06-08 14:34:41,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-djibouti-protests-idUSKBN23F2JB,81
Colombia’s president withdraws tax reform after protests,"BOGOTA, May 2 (Reuters) - Colombian President Ivan Duque said on Sunday he would withdraw a proposed tax reform after deadly protests and widespread lawmaker opposition, though he insisted a reform is still necessary to ensure fiscal stability.

Protests - have led to multiple deaths around the country since they began on Wednesday - continued on Sunday in some cities, despite the announcement. read more

Duque said on Friday the law would be revised to remove some of its most controversial points - including the leveling of sales tax on utilities and some food - but the government had previously insisted it could not be withdrawn.

""I am asking Congress to withdraw the law proposed by the finance ministry and urgently process a new law that is the fruit of consensus, in order to avoid financial uncertainty,"" Duque said in a video.

The reform, which the government has insisted is vital to stabilizing Colombia's finances, maintaining its credit rating and funding social programs, remains necessary, Duque said.

Political parties, local officials, business leaders and civil society have contributed valuable ideas over the last several days, he said.

There is consensus on the need for temporary taxes on businesses and dividends, an increase in income tax for the wealthiest and deepened state austerity measures, Duque said.

""It is a moment for all of us to work together without malice,"" he said.

The central bank warned on Friday failure to approve the reform could have a negative impact on the economy, while a loss of the country's investment-grade credit rating has already been priced in by many investors.

Lawmakers, unions and other groups hailed the announcement as a victory. Celebratory cacerolazos, a traditional protest where people beat pots and pans, could be heard in some neighborhoods.

""It is the youth, social organizations and mobilized citizens who have seen deaths and defeated the government,"" leftist Senator Ivan Cepeda said on Twitter. ""May the government not present the same reform with make-up. The citizens won't accept tricks.""

There is not yet a definite national count of deaths connected to protests, amid incidents of looting, destruction of public transport and road blockades in several cities.

Local officials in Cali, the country's third-largest city and where demonstrations have been the most violent, have confirmed three. One death each occurred in the city of Neiva and the municipality of Madrid and a police officer was killed in Soacha.

The procurator's office said in an afternoon statement it was investigating 14 deaths nationally, while human rights groups have alleged police abuses - especially in Cali - and said deaths number more than 20.

The national police director said the force would contribute all necessary information to the procurator's investigations.

Duque said late on Saturday cities at high risk for disturbances would get military assistance, an offer rejected by Bogota Mayor Claudia Lopez.

"Australians may face longer lockdown after ""reckless"" mass protests","Summary New South Wales reports 141 new local cases, 2 deaths

Victoria on track to ease curbs

Australia secures 85 mln Pfizer booster shots

MELBOURNE, July 25 (Reuters) - Australia's New South Wales logged its second-highest daily increase of the year in locally acquired COVID-19 cases on Sunday amid fears of a wave of new infections after thousands of people joined an anti-lockdown protest.

""In relation to yesterday's protests, can I say how absolutely disgusted I was. It broke my heart,"" Gladys Berejiklian, the premier of the country's most populous state, told reporters.

""I hope it won't be a setback, but it could be,"" she said.

There were 141 COVID-19 cases reported, down from 163 a day earlier. The outbreak, which began in June, is being driven by the highly contagious Delta variant of the virus, and has now infected 2,081 people in New South Wales. There are 43 people in intensive care, up from 37 a day earlier.

Under fire for a slow vaccine rollout, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said more vaccine supply was not going to ensure New South Wales gets out of lockdown, but what was needed was an effective, properly enforced lockdown.

""Let me be clear - there's not an alternative to the lockdown in New South Wales to get this under control. There is no other magic bullet that's going to do that,"" Morrison told reporters at a televised media conference.

He called the anti-lockdown protests in Sydney reckless and self-defeating.

While Berejiklian and other state leaders have blamed Canberra for the slow vaccine rollout, critics have said NSW did not enforce its stay-at-home orders, which has led to Delta variant leaks to other states.

At least 38 of the new cases in NSW had spent time in the community while infectious, state health authorities said. Numbers of such cases have stayed stubbornly high even after four weeks of lockdown in Sydney, now expected to be extended beyond July 30.

The state reported two deaths overnight, including a woman in her 30s with no pre-existing conditions.

Despite its struggle with spikes of infections, Australia has managed to keep its epidemic largely under control with a total of about 32,600 cases and 918 deaths.

To help speed up vaccinations in Sydney, the government's official adviser, the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (ATAGI), on Saturday changed its advice on the AstraZeneca vaccine, urging anyone in the city under the age of 60 to strongly consider getting vaccinated with it.

ATAGI had previously advised against the AstraZeneca vaccine for people under 60 due to concerns about blood clots.

""In the context of the current risk of COVID-19 in NSW and with the ongoing constraints on Comirnaty (Pfizer) vaccine supplies, all adults in greater Sydney should strongly consider the benefits of earlier protection with COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca rather than waiting for alternative vaccines,"" ATAGI said in a statement.

Morrison said on Sunday the government has secured an additional 85 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine, but they will only be delivered in 2022 and 2023.

""To have those booster shots pre-ordered means we can go into 2022 with confidence,"" he said.

Australia's Victoria state reported 11 locally acquired COVID-19 cases on Sunday, down from 12 a day earlier, raising hopes the state will end a hard lockdown imposed 10 days ago.

State Premier Daniel Andrews said it was too early to say whether restrictions will be eased on Tuesday, but: ""At this stage, though, things are going well.""

All of the cases were linked to the current outbreak clusters and all of them were in isolation throughout their infectious period, the state's health department said.

South Australia reported three new cases on Sunday.

"Germans stage protests against lockdown measures, social distancing rules","BERLIN (Reuters) - Thousands of Germans across the country took to the streets on Saturday to protest against restrictions imposed by the government to contain the coronavirus pandemic, police and organisers said.

Slideshow ( 11 images )

Germany’s death toll from the virus has been lower than most of its European neighbours and some lockdown measures have already been relaxed.

However, protests against the measures Chancellor Angela Merkel insists are needed to slow down the coronavirus outbreak have become more vocal and demonstrators have filled the streets for the second weekend in a row.

Derided on social media as “covidiots” who risk causing a second wave of infections that could lead to a tightening of restrictions, protesters staged demonstrations at several locations across the capital Berlin and the surrounding state of Brandenburg.

In Stuttgart, where some protesters last weekend had been flouting social distancing rules and not wearing face masks, police expected another rally of up to 5,000 people.

In Munich, organisers asked authorities to give the green light for a rally of up to 10,000 people on the Thersienwiese, a large square in the city centre on which Munich normally stages its world famous Oktoberfest beer festival.

But city officials pointed to the need to respect social distancing rules and allowed a demonstration of up to 1,000 people.

The hard core of protesters is being led by several new groups.

One group is Resistance 2020, led by a lawyer from eastern Leipzig and a doctor from south-western Germany who question official corona statistics and view the main political parties as constructs of an elitist rule.

Another group called COMPACT describes itself as the “sharp sword against imperial propaganda”. It declares on its website that it is helping the “information offensive” for the growing protest movement.

“Why aren’t you telling us the truth, Mrs Merkel? How we are losing our freedom, jobs and health?” says COMPACT.

German media have suggested Russia could be behind a misinformation campaign that is spurring on protesters.

After winning global respect for keeping the death rate low in Germany, Merkel last week bowed to pressure from some of Germany’s powerful regional premiers and agreed to a gradual re-opening of schools, shops and restaurants and even soccer.

However, Merkel, a scientist, has repeatedly warned about a second wave of infections, and a brief uptick in the reproduction rate to above the critical threshold of 1 earlier this week caused fresh concern.

The new coronavirus has so far infected more than 173,000 people in Germany and killed nearly 7,900.

Most Germans approve Merkel’s crisis management, with polls showing support for her conservative CDU/CSU alliance surging to 40%. A survey released on Thursday showed that 56% of the population back the current lockdown measures.",2020-05-16 10:14:25,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-germany-protests-idUSKBN22S0MS,84
Peru's Castillo fends off Congress impeachment vote amid protests,"LIMA, Dec 7 (Reuters) - Peruvian President Pedro Castillo gained breathing room on Tuesday after Congress voted against a motion to impeach him amid protests in capital city Lima both for and against the under-fire leftist leader.

Peruvian lawmakers voted 76 against the motion and 46 in favor, short of the threshold required to proceed to an impeachment trial, after Castillo garnered support in recent days to fend off the attempt to oust him by right-wing parties.

The impeachment vote had threatened to tip Peru into political uncertainty with Castillo battling crises as his popularity wanes months into his administration amid corruption allegations and widespread mining protests. read more

Castillo's own party, the Marxist Peru Libre, had at one point considered supporting the motion, though on Monday rallied behind the president despite clashing with him over policy and called the attempt a right-wing coup. read more

""The impeachment motion failed, fascism failed, the parliamentary blow to democracy failed,"" Peru Libre leader Vladimir Cerron, who hasn't always seen eye-to-eye with more moderate Castillo, said on Twitter after the vote.

Earlier in the day hundreds of protesters supporting and opposing Castillo, a former teacher from a peasant farming family, had congregated around Congress.

""We want him to keep working,"" said María Lázaro Cornelio, a protester supporting Castillo, who came to office in July pledging major social change. ""We want him to keep his word on things that he has promised us.""

Another protester, who gave her name as Jacky, said she wanted Castillo out because she alleged he was ""destroying Peru, destroying our economy and the freedom of all Peruvians.""

The impeachment push, backed by right-wing lawmaker and defeated presidential candidate Keiko Fujimori, had appeared to lose steam in recent days after Castillo held talks with various political parties.

""""The issue of vacating (the presidency) is slowly being deflated,"" Vice President Dina Boluarte had told reporters earlier on Tuesday.

The three right-wing parties seeking Castillo's removal controlled 43 legislators. The motion needed 52 votes from the 130 members of Congress to move forward and then 87 votes in a later vote to remove the president from office.

The reprieve comes as prosecutors investigate alleged cases of corruption by aides to Castillo, who accused his opponents and ""economic interest groups"" of conspiring against him.

The Andean country's fragmented Congress has a history of clashing with the executive branch.

The copper-rich country has had five presidents since 2016. In 2018, Pedro Pablo Kuczynski resigned from the presidency minutes before an impeachment vote, while centrist Martín Vizcarra was ousted following two impeachment trials last year.

Ugandan opposition party says it will challenge election result; two dead in protests,"KAMPALA (Reuters) - Ugandan opposition leader Bobi Wine’s party said on Sunday that it was preparing to challenge President Yoweri Museveni’s election win and condemned what it called the house arrest of Wine, as news emerged of two people killed in protests over the result.

Protests broke out on Saturday after results from Thursday’s election were announced in two areas, Luwero district north of Kampala and Masaka to the southwest, and security forces killed two people and arrested 23 in total, NTV Uganda reported on Sunday, citing local police.

No other details were immediately available about the protests.

A nationwide internet blackout since the day before the vote has slowed the flow of information about the process.

“We have evidence of ballot stuffing and other forms of election malpractice and after putting it together we are going to take all measures that the law permits to challenge this fraud,” Maathias Mpuuga of Wine’s National Unity Party (NUP) told a news conference.

On Saturday the electoral commission declared Museveni the winner of Thursday’s vote, with final counts showing the president won 59% of votes to Wine’s 35%. Announcing the results, the commission congratulated Ugandans on a peaceful and successful process.

The United States and Britain issued statements on Saturday calling for investigations into fraud reports and other concerns over the electoral process. The campaign and election were marked by a deadly crackdown by security forces on opposition candidates and their supporters and an internet shutdown.

The African Union sent an observer tean but it did not arrive in Uganda until the day before the vote due to COVID-19 related issues, and observed polling only in the capital and its immediate environs, it said in a statement, describing its work as “more of a solidarity mission” than an “classical election observer mission.” An African election monitoring group that deployed 2,000 Ugandan observers reported irregularities.

Museveni, 76, in power since 1986 and one of Africa’s longest-serving leaders, said after he was declared winner that the election may turn out to be the “most cheating free” in Uganda’s history.

In his victory speech, Museveni he said he was in politics to address historical challenges and reiterated a pre-election message that his government would deal decisively with anyone who disrupted peace in the country.

Wine’s party said at the news conference that the opposition leader and his wife are unable to leave their home, which it said is surrounded by soldiers and police who are blocking members of his party and journalists from entering.

Wine, a 38-year-old musician-turned-lawmaker whose real name is Robert Kyagulanyi, was not reachable on Sunday.

On Friday and Saturday Wine told Reuters that he believed his life was in danger, that he was being silenced by Museveni’s government, and that he urged Ugandans to reject the election results.

Slideshow ( 5 images )

He also called on Western governments who have provided billions of dollars in aid to Uganda to hold the government accountable for what he called “mockery of democracy.”

Wine’s party also said that one of its MPs, Francis Zaake, was arrested on Friday while trying to access their leader’s compound. After being beaten by security forces, he was hospitalized for treatment of injuries, party spokesman Joel Seenyonye said at the news conference.

Police, military and government spokespeople did not immediately respond on Sunday to requests for comment on the scene at Wine’s house, or on Zaake.

The government said during pre-election campaigning that it arrested opposition members and their supporters for breaking laws governing public order and COVID-19 restrictions on gatherings.

On Saturday, a military spokesman told Reuters that security officers at Wine’s house were assessing threats he could face and might be preventing him from leaving for his own safety.

With results still coming in, Wine’s NUP won 56 seats in the new parliament, local media reported, up from zero in the previous parliament.

Anger on campus: Behind the student protests that have rocked Indonesia,"JAKARTA (Reuters) - He was once a boy scout and member of a patriotic flag-raising team in high school.

But with student protests sweeping Jakarta and other cities in recent months in some of the worst civil unrest to hit Indonesia in decades, Manik Marganamahendra has emerged as an anti-establishment icon.

“Today we stand on Indonesian land, on land seized and corrupted by the oligarchy,” he bellowed through a sound system on a recent afternoon, standing on the bed of a pickup truck.

Thousands of chanting students, clad in the yellow, red and green jackets of their universities, swirled in front of him, watched closely by a line of riot police standing behind large coils of barbed wire.

“If elite politicians are able to make a coalition, why can’t the people?” he cried.

Draped from the truck was a banner bearing the slogan that has been the rallying cry for the student-led protests that erupted in September: “reform corrupted”.

The trigger for the protests was a government move to strip the country’s anti-corruption agency of some of its powers and pass a new criminal code that critics saw as a reversal of hard-won social and political reforms that followed the fall of the authoritarian Suharto government in the late 1990s.

But the protests have also attracted a broader swathe of activists pressing for a host of other causes that highlight a growing sentiment in Indonesia that a political and business elite is becoming increasingly beholden to special interests and less accountable to the people.

Workers are pressing for better conditions. Environmentalists want palm oil and timber companies to be more accountable for the forest fires that regularly blanket the region in smoke. Feminists are calling for the passage of an anti-sexual violence bill that has been blocked by politicians fearing a backlash from conservative Muslims.

Rattled by the increasingly violent protests, the authorities have delayed the passage of the criminal code, which would have banned pre-marital sex and penalized insults against the president.

However, President Joko Widodo has said that there are no plans to reverse changes to laws governing the Corruption Eradication Commission, which has prosecuted hundreds of politicians, officials and businessmen since its formation in 2002, saying the agency needed better governance.

Slideshow ( 29 images )

The new law placed restrictions on the agency using independent wiretaps, among other measures.

Hundreds of people have been injured in clashes with the police. Five people have died during protests. Police have announced the arrest of an officer over the deaths of two students, including one who died of gunshot wounds. But it is still unclear how the others died. Under pressure from families and human rights groups, Widodo has ordered an investigation into the deaths.

While the protests have lost some intensity in recent weeks, the students have vowed to keep up their campaign and are planning a demonstration on Sunday - national Heroes Day.

The movement will not run out of steam, Marganamahendra told Reuters. “We want the future to be better than today.”

UNLIKELY LEADER

Students like Marganamahendra have been a critical force in the protests, helping to forge a loose network with the disparate groups involved.

“We want to show that a college student movement - any student movement - and a labor movement can unite,” he told Reuters at a rally last month near the presidential palace, dressed in the yellow jacket of the University of Indonesia.

Quietly spoken and with a slight frame, the 22-year-old public health student is an unlikely figure to emerge as a leader of the protest movement. He comes from a modest background in the city of Bogor, south of Jakarta; his father is a motorcycle taxi driver, and his mother is unemployed.

But Marganamahendra has emerged as a powerful speaker and charismatic presence in front of the protest crowds, able to rally and organize the students. He has also become something of a celebrity in Indonesia, with local media running stories on everything from his favorite pastime (debating, reportedly) to his love life. On campus, other students ask him to pose for selfies with them.

He has also found himself targeted by trolls on social media who have questioned his motives and say the protests have been hijacked by people hoping to overthrow Widodo’s presidency.

Slideshow ( 29 images )

“I feel a certain pressure psychologically,” he said.

ANGRY STUDENTS

Marganamahendra’s life today is a far cry from what it was in mid September when he and a handful of University of Indonesia students joined one of the first protests.

There, he met students from other universities and discussed coordinating activities. Soon, students from his university were meeting with a broad range of people with grievances against the government – farmers, union activists, feminists and others.

The media-savvy students and activists created punchy online hashtags to raise awareness of their campaign, and used crowd-funding sites like Kitabisa.com to raise cash for renting trucks and loudspeakers, and buying medical supplies and food. They communicated with each other using WhatsApp.

By the end of September, the rallies had grown into some of the largest seen in the country since the 1998 protests that helped bring down Suharto, with the size of the crowds put at over 52,000 at their height by news magazine Tempo, citing the National Police Intelligence and Security Agency.

“Many students on campus were angry, not just the type who get involved in student organizations,” said Marganamahendra.

Nailendra, a student from Yogyakarta’s Gadjah Mada University in Java, said there was a feeling of “having to do something” after heated discussions broke out at her campus canteen about the government bills, which she called “very unreasonable”.

“We started with our small circle and then we used social media and brought in other groups and people to join the alliance,” said Nailendra, who uses one name and is a spokeswoman for the People’s Movement Alliance. “Now our group is very diverse.”

LIST OF DEMANDS

The demonstrators have also drawn inspiration from the protests that have rocked Hong Kong this year, Marganamahendra said.

Like their Hong Kong counterparts they have drawn up a list of key demands, with the Indonesians focusing on the anti-graft agency and the criminal code, as well as the removal of the military and police from government, making companies accountable for the forest fires, and freeing political prisoners in the restive region of Papua.

“The Hong Kong movement is really cool,” Marganamahendra said.

The organized opposition and simmering discontent suggested by the protests could pose a challenge to Widodo as he starts a second five-year term, even though he is backed by parties controlling 74% of seats in parliament, analysts say. The criminal code, which is championed by conservatives that Widodo has been reluctant to confront, is expected to eventually make a return.

“Depending on how the government proceeds with legal and political reform, there is a risk authorities could trigger a much wider protest movement,” said Donald Greenlees, senior advisor to Asialink, a think-tank affiliated with the University of Melbourne.",2019-11-07 18:32:06,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-indonesia-politics-rights-student-ins-idUSKBN1XH2XI,87
Turkish police detain 159 people at protests over Erdogan-appointed university head,"ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkish police on Monday detained 159 people over protests in Istanbul against President Tayyip Erdogan’s appointment of a new rector at one of the country’s top universities, the Istanbul Governor’s office said.

Slideshow ( 5 images )

Students at the Bogazici University in Istanbul began their protests nearly a month ago, saying the appointment of Melih Bulu as rector was undemocratic. Teachers at Bogazici have also protested Bulu’s swearing-in.

Protesters chanting slogans such as “Police, get out” and “Universities are ours” clashed and scuffled with the police on Monday.

In a statement, the Istanbul Governor’s office said 159 people had later been detained for “not ending the demonstrations in front of the Bogazici University despite warnings,” and added that an investigation had been launched.

Earlier, more than 100 police gathered at the main entrance of the campus. They allowed university students to enter, checking their IDs, but told others to leave, including several lawmakers, mainly from the pro-Kurdish Peoples Democratic Party (HDP).

Sidewalks next to the roads leading up to the university were fenced off, and minor scuffles broke out as some protesters began chanting and walking toward the police barricade.

Kemal Kilicdaroglu, leader of the main opposition Republican People’s Party (CHP), criticised the detentions late on Monday on Twitter, calling on Bulu to resign to end “this ugly situation”.

Istanbul Mayor Ekrem Imamoglu, also from the CHP, said he had spoken with authorities to establish dialogue between them and the protesters, adding he would meet with Bogazici students on Tuesday to hear their concerns.

Bulu, who has applied to be a candidate for Erdogan’s ruling AK Party in a 2015 parliamentary election, was the first rector chosen from outside a university since a military coup in Turkey in 1980, Bogazici faculty members have said.

The protesters have also been demanding the release of four people who had been detained after images were shared on social media of them laying a picture on the ground that mixed sacred Islamic iconography with symbols supporting LGBT issues.

Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu said at the weekend that four “LGBT perverts” had been detained, while Erdogan on Monday praised his ruling AK Party’s youth wing for “not being the LGBT youth.”",2021-02-01 16:33:14,https://www.reuters.com/article/turkey-security-bogazici-int-idUSKBN2A13OU,88
French protests call for 'freedom' amid government vaccine push,"PARIS, July 17 (Reuters) - More than a hundred thousand people marched across France on Saturday to protest against President Emmanuel Macron's plans to force vaccination of health workers and require a COVID-19 free certificate to enter places such as restaurants and cinemas.

Macron this week announced sweeping measures to fight a rapid surge in coronavirus infections, which protesters say infringe the freedom of choice of those who do not want the vaccination.

The interior ministry said 137 marches took place across the country, gathering nearly 114,000 people, of which 18,000 were in Paris.

The measures had already prompted smaller demonstrations earlier this week, forcing police to use tear gas to disperse protesters.

""Everyone is sovereign in his own body. In no way does a president of the Republic have the right to decide on my individual health,"" said one protester in Paris who identified herself as Chrystelle.

Marches also included ""yellow vest"" protesters seeking to revive the anti-government movement curbed by coronavirus lockdowns.

Visiting a centre in Anglet in southwestern France, Prime Minister Jean Castex said vaccination, which is not mandatory for the general public for now, is the only way to fight the virus.

""I hear the reluctance that arises but I think that we must at all costs convince all our fellow citizens to be vaccinated, it is the best way to cope to this health crisis,"" Castex said.

Despite the strength of the protests, an Ipsos-Sopra Steria poll released on Friday found more than 60% of French people agree with mandatory vaccination for health workers, as well as a requirement for a health pass in some public places.

Fast-spreading variants of the virus risk undermining economic recovery if allowed to spiral out of control, forcing some governments to rethink their COVID-19 strategies just as citizens start their summer holidays.

Earlier on Saturday Castex's office said France would reinforce restrictions on unvaccinated travellers from a series of countries to counter a rebound in COVID-19 infections, while opening its doors to those who have received all their shots.

""The Delta variant is here, we must not hide the truth, it is more contagious than the previous ones. We must adapt and face it"", Castex told reporters in southwestern France, referring to the variant first identified in India.

After falling from more than 42,000 per day in mid-April to less than 2,000 per day in late June, the average number of new infections in France has rebounded to reach nearly 11,000 per day.

Some 55.5% of the French had had a single dose of a vaccine as of Saturday and 44.8% were fully inoculated.

Anti-immigrant protesters chant 'Resistance!' in German city after killing,"CHEMNITZ, Germany (Reuters) - Hundreds of anti-immigration protesters chanting “Resistance!” demonstrated in the German city of Chemnitz on Thursday after a series of violent confrontations that followed the killing of a German man by two immigrants.

Police in the eastern state of Saxony have brought in reinforcements from across Germany after clashes at two days of protests which followed the arrest of a Syrian and an Iraqi over Sunday’s fatal stabbing of the man, named only as “Daniel H.”.

Germany is deeply divided over Chancellor Angela Merkel’s 2015 decision to allow in over a million migrants, many of them refugees from wars in Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan.

Heightening concerns about possible links between police and the far-right in Saxony, prosecutors also announced that an officer had confessed to leaking what was supposed to be a confidential arrest warrant for the Iraqi suspect. This was widely published on far-right websites, fuelling the protests.

Far right protesters sang the national anthem outside the Chemnitz football stadium on Thursday while one group held up a banner proclaiming “We are standing up for our children” as speakers with megaphones addressed the crowd.

In a hall within the stadium, Saxony’s premier Michael Kretschmer called for a minute’s silence to remember the victim of the killing.

“We will see to it that this crime is cleared up,” he told a meeting of concerned citizens attended by several hundred. Earlier, he had promised to make sure “those who ran through the city with Hitler salutes are also convicted.”

Chemnitz lies in the former Communist East Germany which has become the heartland of anti-immigrant groups including PEGIDA and the Alternative for Germany (AfD) political party. The AfD won 13 percent of the vote in a 2017 federal election, its strongest showing yet.

In Wismar, another eastern town, police appealed for witnesses to an attack late on Wednesday on a 20-year-old migrant who was beaten with an iron chain by three assailants.

Chemnitz mayor Barbara Ludwig vowed to clean up her city’s image. “In this confrontation between love and hate we have to meet in the middle to make this city worth living in,” she told reporters.

The AfD and PEGIDA, which is under observation by intelligence agencies, say they will march again in Chemnitz on Saturday to “mourn Daniel H. and the others killed by Germany’s forced multiculturalization.”",2018-08-30 03:50:36,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-germany-protests-idUSKCN1LF0O9,90
"Outnumbered and elderly, Okinawa protesters oppose U.S. military runway","(This April 3 story corrects speaker’s name in paragraph 13 to Shiroma)

OKINAWA (Reuters) - A month after Jinshiro Motoyama’s five-day hunger strike forced a referendum over a new U.S. military runway on Japan’s island of Okinawa, he came to bid farewell to a knot of protesters trying to block trucks heading for the building site.

The referendum showed 70 percent of voters opposed expansion of a U.S. Marines base at Henoko on the island, but the vote was non-binding and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s government decided to forge ahead with a project long promised to Washington.

“It’s going to be a long battle,” said Motoyama, 27, adding that he was returning to Tokyo, the capital, to resume his study of foreign relations, because he needed to eventually get a job and earn a living.

“I will continue my studies and hope to help in the future. I hope I can encourage the next generation too,” he added, standing near a sign that urged protesters not to give up.

With leaders like Motoyama standing down and few islanders willing to protest at the base every day, despite the referendum’s overwhelming no vote, the plan to build the runway on coral reefs seems to face few obstacles.

The base, expected to be complete in five years, will host aircraft and troops from a residential area about 50 km (31 miles) south at the Futenma air station, which the United States and Japan agreed to close in 1996, after three U.S. servicemen raped a 12-year-old girl.

Many Japanese want the Marine units to leave altogether, to ease the burden on the militarized island.

Okinawa saw some of the bloodiest fighting in World War Two, and U.S. bases home to 50,000 U.S. citizens, among them 30,000 troops and civilian contractors, occupy about a fifth of the island.

But a rapid U.S. military departure is unlikely, because Washington wants a presence on the strategic island chain fringing the East China Sea as the power of neighboring China grows.

As Chinese warplanes and warships make longer, more frequent forays through the waters into the Western Pacific, Japan has built radar bases, anti-ship missile batteries and deployed stealth fighters in response.

HAULED AWAY

At Henoko, protesters sat in the road to block trucks bringing sand for the new runway, a tactic repeated hundreds of times during more than a decade of demonstrations.

But they were outnumbered by security guards, who hauled away the protesters, many of them elderly, one by one.

“We know young people like Motoyama worked hard to make the referendum happen,” said one of them, 73-year-old Masaru Shiroma. “Our biggest concern is they will lose heart and give up.”

He vowed not to give up, calling the referendum “a starting point for this new battle in Okinawa.”

As a U.S. tilt-rotor Osprey transport flew overhead, Motoyama looked up, recalling how the roar of military jets often woke him as a schoolboy, and made it hard to play baseball too.

“You can’t hear the ball hit the bat, which can be dangerous, if you’re an outfielder like I was.”",2019-04-03 03:05:04,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-japan-okinawa-henoko-idUSKCN1RF0KC,91
Released Senegal opposition leader calls for more protests,"DAKAR (Reuters) - Senegal opposition leader Ousmane Sonko called on Monday for more protests against President Macky Sall after being indicted and released on bail over a rape charge that has sparked violent unrest across the country.

Sonko’s release was cheered by participants in the protests that have buffeted one of West Africa’s most stable democracies in the past week, leaving at least eight dead in clashes with police, according to rights group Amnesty International.

After being freed, Sonko asked supporters to continue demonstrations, but emphasised they should be peaceful.

“We are not asking the people to go and unseat Macky Sall,” he said at a news conference.

“But let’s be clear, the revolution is marching its way to 2024,” he said in reference to the next presidential election.

Earlier hundreds gathered outside the courthouse waving flags and chanting “Free Sonko” before beginning to march as army tanks patrolled downtown streets.

It was unclear how his release would affect plans for three days of nationwide protests from Monday. The unrest is the worst the country has seen in years as youth also vent frustrations about unemployment, inequality and corruption.

In his first public comments since the start of the turmoil, Sall said he understood why young people had taken to the streets.

“Because you don’t have a job, because you aspire to a better future,” he said in a televised speech, pledging to provide extra funding to support employment and entrepreneurship.

He promised to shorten a nightly pandemic-linked curfew that has proved particularly unpopular, stifling the informal economy on which millions depend.

“I will use all the powers conferred on me by my office to support a return to calm,” he said.

Political pressure has risen against Sall, whose tenure has been plagued by accusations that he unjustly torpedoes political challengers and worries that he may seek to extend his rule beyond his allotted two-term limit.

Sonko, who finished third in the 2019 presidential election, was arrested last Wednesday after an employee of a beauty salon accused him of raping her. He denies the accusation and says it is an attempt by Sall to kneecap a rival.

The government denies this.

Many are suspicious of the accusations against Sonko because two other prominent rivals of Sall were previously targeted by criminal charges that prevented them from running for president in 2019.",2021-03-09 02:17:27,https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-senegal-politics-sonko-idUSKBN2B10NV,92
Thai protesters demand PM resign amid surge in COVID cases,"BANGKOK, Aug 1 (Reuters) - Anti-government protesters in Thailand took to the streets in cars and motorcycles on Sunday, demanding the resignation of Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha over his handling of the spread of COVID-19, as the country struggles with its biggest outbreak to date.

In Bangkok, drivers honked horns and motorcyclists raised three-finger salutes - a gesture of resistance inspired by ""The Hunger Games"" movie - as they headed along a 20 km (12 miles) route stretching from the Democracy Monument in the centre of the capital out to Don Muang International Airport.

""We can barely make a living now, all of my family members have been affected,"" said a 47-year-old protester speaking from his car who only gave his first name ""Chai"", for fear of government repercussions.

""The government failed to provide vaccines on time and many of us haven't had any vaccine yet,"" he said. ""If we don't come out to make our calls, the government will simply ignore us.""

There were also similar protests in other provinces.

The Southeast Asian country aims to inoculate 50 million people by the end of 2021, but so far, only 5.8% of its more than 66 million population are fully vaccinated, while about 21% have received at least one dose.

On Sunday, Thailand reported 18,027 new infections and 133 new deaths from COVID-19, bringing total accumulated cases to 615,314 and 4,990 fatalities.

Fake news muddies online waters during Cuba protests,"HAVANA, July 16 (Reuters) - False news reports spread fast following unprecedented protests in Cuba last Sunday, among them: Raul Castro had fled to ally Venezuela, protesters had kidnapped a provincial Communist Party chief, and Caracas was sending in troops.

The Cuban government said they were spread by counter-revolutionaries, while critics of the government said they may have come from the authorities themselves. Neither provided evidence for their claims and Reuters was unable to ascertain the origins of the stories.

The Cuban government said the stories, which spread on social media and messaging apps, were part of a broader U.S.-backed attempt by counter-revolutionaries to destabilize the country.

""What calumnies, what lies,"" said President Miguel Diaz-Canel late on Wednesday, exposing some of the fake news stories on a televised roundtable. ""The way they are using social media is poisonous and alienating.""

""It is an expression of media terrorism,"" he said.

Government critics said authorities could be planting the stories to muddy online waters with misinformation and sow confusion so that no-one trusts future news of unrest.

""Often it is state security launching these kind of rumors to afterwards... say they are foreign-directed campaigns to manipulate Cubans so people stop trusting in information circulating outside government control,"" wrote Mexican-based communications specialist Jose Raul Gallego on Facebook.

Both the government and some of its most prominent critics urged Cubans to take care not to share non-verified information. Some of the stories were amplified by Cubans abroad cheering on the protests.

The proliferation of manufactured or misleading videos and content on social media has become a common feature of social protests around the world in recent years, including in Chile, Bolivia, the United States and France.

Thousands took to the streets in towns around Cuba last Sunday to protest power outages, a COVID-19 surge, widespread shortages of basic goods and the one-party system.

Those protests, the biggest in decades in Cuba - where public dissent is restricted - petered out this week as security forces were deployed and government supporters mobilized.

Early reports of protests on Sunday were also followed swiftly by internet outages and restrictions on social media and messaging platforms. Service was slowly returning to normal by Friday.

SOCIAL MEDIA - TOOL OR BURDEN?

The introduction of mobile internet just over two years ago and the subsequent flourishing of social media and independent news outlets in Cuba has been a key factor behind the protests.

These tools have given Cubans a platform to share and amplify their frustrations and enabled the word to get out quickly when people are on the street, analysts say. Many Cubans learned of Sunday's protests on messaging applications like WhatsApp or on Facebook.

But Cuba's government, which has long had a monopoly on mass media, warned citizens against believing news and images shared on social media that may have been manipulated.

Posts shared thousands of times in recent days were mislabeled as Cuban protests. Some included photos that showed a large crowd during Cuba's 2018 May Day march or a protest in Egypt in 2011.

Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez accused social media platforms of generally only launching investigations into suspected fake news when it hurt the ""powerful.""

""It's known which monopolies operate in the digital space... how they work, in which countries they are headquarters... and how much politics goes on,"" he told a news briefing on Tuesday.

Twitter, which has not reported taking down any coordinated attempts to influence events around the Cuba protests with misinformation, said in a statement: ""Investigations are ongoing. We'll continue to monitor the situation and remain vigilant.""

Facebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Reinaldo Escobar, editor of independent news site 14ymedio, said that regardless of who published the fake news and with what motivation, many Cubans now had the direct experience of participating in or observing genuine spontaneous demonstrations.

""This massive coming out of the closet of fear will have consequences,"" he said.

HAVANA, July 14 (Reuters) - Cuba announced on Wednesday it was temporarily lifting restrictions on the amount of food and medicine travelers could bring into the country in an apparent small concession to demands by protesters who took to the street last weekend.

Thousands joined a wave of nationwide protests over shortages of basic goods, curbs on civil liberties and the government's handling of a surge in COVID-19 infections on Sunday, in the most significant unrest in decades in the Communist-run country.

The government blamed the unrest on U.S.-financed ""counter-revolutionaries"" exploiting hardship caused by the decades-old U.S. trade embargo that Washington tightened in the midst of the pandemic, pushing the Cuban economy to the brink.

Several countries and the United Nations have called on the government to respect citizens' right to express themselves. Others like Mexico have said the best way to help the Cuban people would be for the United States to ease sanctions.

In Cuba, a growing number of high-profile artists from salsa band Los Van Van to jazz pianist Chucho Valdes have criticized the authorities’ handling of the unrest, urging them to listen to protesters rather than fight them.

Intermittent internet outages that activists say were designed to tamp any further unrest eased slightly on Wednesday although access to social media and messaging services remained restricted.

Officials have blamed a campaign on social media under the hashtag #SOSCuba calling for humanitarian aid for fueling the protests, saying it was launched by U.S.-backed mercenaries seeking to destabilize the Communist-run country.

They compared the push to a U.S.-backed effort to send relief to Venezuela in 2019 that ended in a violent standoff on the Colombian border.

Still, one of the campaign's demands was for the government to lift customs restrictions on food, medicine and hygiene products that are lacking in the country amid its worst economic crisis since the fall of former ally the Soviet Union.

And Prime Minister Manuel Marrero said on Wednesday the government would do precisely that from next Monday, lifting restrictions until the year-end.

""It was a demand made by many travelers and it was necessary to take this decision,"" he said on a roundtable on state television, alongside President Miguel Diaz-Canel.

It was not immediately clear how much difference the move would make given that there are very few flights at the moment into the Caribbean island nation which is going through its worst coronavirus outbreak since the start of the pandemic.

Government critic Yoani Sanchez, who runs news website 14ymedio, was quick to tweet that such concessions would not be enough to appease those who had protested on Sunday.

""We do not want crumbs, we want freedom, and we want it nowwwww,"" she wrote. ""The streets have spoken: we are not afraid.""

Cubans say they have been frustrated by outages in mobile internet and restricted access to social media and messaging platforms since Sunday.

""It's been a bunch of days that noone has been able to connect,"" said Havana resident Andrea Lopez. ""My husband is in Mexico and I haven't been able to speak with him.""

More than 200 people were detained during or following the protests, according to exiled rights group Cubalex, and only a handful have been released so far.

Diaz-Canel said there were three kinds of protesters; counter-revolutionaries, criminals and those with legitimate frustrations. State-run television showed images of a crowd looting a store and another attacking an empty police car.

Interior ministry officials said in a program televised later that some of the detained would be pursued for crimes like incitement to violence, contempt, robbery and damage to public property, which carry lengthy prison sentences.

South Korean protesters denounce U.S. anti-missile system ahead of North-South summit,"SEOUL (Reuters) - Construction trucks moved into a South Korean base housing a U.S. anti-missile system on Monday, infuriating villagers opposed to its deployment, two days after North Korea vowed to suspend nuclear tests and ahead of a North-South summit.

Thousands of riot police moved in to disperse the protesters who tried to keep supplies from reaching the site of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system in the southern city of Seongju, just days before the first North-South summit since 2007.

“A peace treaty is being discussed... There is no more North Korea (nuclear threat) as an excuse (for deployment of THAAD). We can neither understand nor accept construction plans to operate the THAAD,” the THAAD residents’ committee said in a statement.

The system is aimed at defending against an attack by North Korea which has been pursuing nuclear and missile programs in defiance of U.N. Security Council resolutions, prompting threats of war from both the North and the United States.

But tensions have eased in recent months, with the North participating in the Winter Olympics in the South and a summit planned between North and South this week and between the North and the United States in May or June.

Residents have been blocking the only road to the site since mid-2017, forcing the U.S. military to use helicopters to shuttle in fuel, food and other supplies. The government’s move on Monday to bring in trucks sparked fierce opposition.

The planned construction at the base is aimed at improving power supplies and accommodation for U.S. and South Korean troops stationed there.

Thousands of riot police were dispatched to remove about 200 protesters, Yonhap News Agency said. Dozens were seen tussling with police, yelling and demanding ambulances be called, live footage through Facebook showed.

“It is imperative to improve living conditions of troops based in Seongju city. We can no longer delay this so the ministry started deploying workers, materials and equipment needed for the construction today,” a Defence Ministry official said.

THAAD, designed to shoot down short- to medium-range missiles, has also angered China which believes the system’s radar could be used to penetrate its territory.

North Korea said on Saturday it would halt nuclear and missile tests and said it was scrapping its Punggye-ri test site to pursue economic growth and peace.
